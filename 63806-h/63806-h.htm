<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Mrs. Robinson</span> conveyed sundry dishes from
the oven, also the teapot from the hob, to the
table.</p>

<p>“Come awa’,” she said briskly, seating herself.
“We’ll no’ wait for Macgreegor.”</p>

<p>“Gi’e him five minutes, Lizzie,” said Mr. Robinson.</p>

<p>“I’m in nae hurry,” remarked Gran’paw Purdie,
who had come up from the coast that afternoon.</p>

<p>“I’m awfu’ hungry, Maw,” piped a young voice.</p>

<p>“Whisht, Jimsie,” whispered daughter Jeannie.</p>

<p>Said Mrs. Robinson, a little impatiently:
“Come awa’, come awa’, afore everything gets
spiled. Macgreegor has nae business to be that
late.” She glanced at the clock. “He’s been the
same a’ week. Haste ye, John.”</p>

<p>John opened his mouth, but catching his wife’s
eye, closed it again without speech.</p>

<p>Excepting Jimsie, they came to the table rather
reluctantly.</p>

<p>“Ask a blessin’, fayther,” murmured Lizzie.</p>

<p>“Shut yer eyes,” muttered Jeannie to her little
brother, while she restrained his eager paw from
reaching a cookie.</p>

<p>Mr. Purdie’s white head shook slightly as he said
grace; he had passed his five and seventieth birthday,
albeit his spirit was cheerful as of yore; in his
case old age seemed to content itself with an occasional
mild reminder.</p>

<p>John distributed portions of stewed finnan
haddie, Lizzie poured out the tea, while Jeannie
methodically prepared a small feast for the impatient
Jimsie. Gran’paw Purdie beamed on the
four, but referred surreptitiously at brief intervals
to his fat silver watch.</p>

<p class="center">&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;</p>

<p>It is eight years since last we saw the Robinson
family. Naturally we find the greatest changes in
the younger members. Jimsie from an infant has
become a schoolboy; he is taller, more scholarly,
less disposed to mischief, more subdued of nature
than was Macgregor at the same age; yet he is
the frank, animated young query that his brother
was, though, to be sure, he has a sister as well as
parents to puzzle with his questions. At thirteen
Jeannie is a comely, fair-haired little maid, serious
for her years, devoted to Jimsie, very proud of
Macgregor, and a blessing to her parents who,
strangely enough, rarely praise her; her chief end
seems to be to serve those she loves without making
any fuss about it.</p>

<p>As for John, he has grown stouter, and to his
wife’s dismay a bald spot has appeared on his
crown; his laughter comes as readily as ever, and
he is just as prone to spoil his children. But by
this time Lizzie has become assured that her man’s
light-hearted, careless ways do not extend to his
work, that his employers have confidence in their
foreman, and that while he is not likely to rise
higher in his trade, he is still less likely to slip
back. She is proud of the three-roomed modern
flat in which she and hers dwell, and her sense for
orderliness and cleanliness has not lost its keenness.
In person she is but little altered: perhaps
her features have grown a shade softer.</p>

<p class="center">&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;</p>

<p>“Ye see, Maister Purdie,” John was explaining,
“Macgreegor’s busy the noo at a job in the west-end,
an’ that’s the reason he’s late for his tea.”</p>

<p>“’Deed, ay. It’s a lang road for him to come
hame,” said the old man. “An’ is he still likin’
the pentin’ trade?”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay. An’ he’s gettin’ on splendid&mdash;jist
splendid!”</p>

<p>“It’s time enough to be sayin’ that,” Lizzie interposed.
“He’s no’ ony furder on nor a lad o’ his
age ought to be. I’m no’ sayin’ he’s daein’ badly,
fayther; but there’s nae sense in boastin’ aboot
what’s jist or’nar’?&mdash;Na, Jimsie! it’s no’ time for
jeelly yet. Tak’ what Jeannie gi’es ye, laddie.&mdash;Ay,
the least <span class="lock">said&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“But his employer’s pleased wi’ him; he tell’t
me as much, wife,” said John. “An’ if ye compare
Macgreegor wi’ that young scamp, Wullie
<span class="lock">Thomson&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Oh, if ye compare a man wi’ a monkey, I
daresay it’s no’ sae bad for the man. But, really,
<span class="lock">John&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Maw, where was the man wi’ the monkey?”
enquired Jimsie through bread and butter.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell ye after,” whispered Jeannie, and forthwith
set her mind to improvise a story involving a
human being and his ancestor.</p>

<p>“It’s easy seen,” said Gran’paw, once more consulting
his watch, “that Macgreegor’s workin’ for
his wages. Surely he’ll be gettin’ overtime the
nicht. I hope his employer’s a kind man.”</p>

<p>“I’ve nae doot aboot that,” Lizzie returned.
“He gi’es Macgreegor money for the car when he’s
workin’ in the west-end.”</p>

<p>“That’s a proper maister!” cried Mr. Purdie,
while John smiled as much as to say, “Ay! he kens
Macgreegor’s value!”</p>

<p>“An’ I’m thinkin’,” Lizzie continued, “that
Macgreegor walks hame an’ keeps the pennies to
buy ceegarettes.”</p>

<p>“What?” exclaimed the old man; “has the laddie
commenced the smokin’ a’ready?”</p>

<p>“Oh, naething to speak aboot,” said John, a
trifle apologetically. “They commence earlier than
they did in your day, I suppose, Maister Purdie.
No’ that I wud smoke a ceegarette if I was paid
for ’t.”</p>

<p>“He’s far ower young for the smokin’,” observed
Lizzie.</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> can smoke,” declared Jimsie indiscreetly.
Jeannie pressed his arm.</p>

<p>John guffawed, Gran’paw looked amused until
Lizzie demanded: “What’s that ye’re sayin’,
Jimsie?”</p>

<p>“But I’m no’ a reg’lar smoker,” mumbled Jimsie,
crestfallen.</p>

<p>“Ay,” said John, with a jocular wink at his
father-in-law, “ye’re feart ye singe yer whiskers,
ma mannie.”</p>

<p>“John,” said Lizzie, “it’s naething to joke aboot....
Jimsie, if ever I catch ye at the smokin’, I’ll
stop yer Seturday penny, an’ gi’e ye castor ile instead.
D’ye hear?”</p>

<p>“Hoots!” cried Gran’paw, “that’s a terrible
severe-like punishment, Lizzie!”</p>

<p>“I wud rayther tak’ ile twicet an’ get ma penny,”
quoth Jimsie.</p>

<p>“Hear, hear!” from John.</p>

<p>Lizzie was about to speak when the bell rang.</p>

<p>Jeannie slipped from her chair. “I’ll gang,
Maw,” she said, and went out.</p>

<p>“It’s Macgreegor,” remarked John. “Ha’e ye
kep’ his haddie hot for him, Lizzie?”</p>

<p>“What for wud I dae that?” retorted Mrs.
Robinson in a tone of irony, going over to the oven
and extracting a covered dish.</p>

<p>“Haw!” laughed John. “I kent ye had something
there!”</p>

<p>“What for did ye ask then?”</p>

<p>She came back to the table as her son entered, a
very perceptible odour of his trade about him&mdash;an
odour which she still secretly disliked though nearly
three years had gone since her first whiff of it.
“What kep’ ye?” she enquired, pleasantly enough.</p>

<p>It is possible that Macgregor’s dutiful greeting to
his grandfather prevented his answering the question.
He appeared honestly glad to see the old
man; yet compared with his own the latter’s greeting
was boisterous. He returned his father’s smile,
glanced at his mother who was engaged in filling
his cup, winked at his young brother, and took his
place at the table, between the two men.</p>

<p>“Ye’ll be wearied,” remarked John.</p>

<p>“No’ extra,” he replied, stretching his tired legs
under cover of the table.</p>

<p>“Did ye walk?” his mother asked, passing him
his tea.</p>

<p>“Ay.”</p>

<p>“It’ll be three mile,” said John.</p>

<p>Jeannie came from the fire and put a fresh slice
of toast on his plate. He nodded his thanks, and
she went to her place satisfied and assisted Jimsie
who had got into difficulties with a jam sandwich
that oozed all round.</p>

<p>“What way did ye no’ tak’ the car, laddie?”
enquired Lizzie.</p>

<p>“I’d as sune walk,” he replied, shortly.</p>

<p>“It’s fine to save the siller&mdash;eh, Macgreegor?”
said Mr. Purdie.</p>

<p>Macgregor reddened.</p>

<p>“It’s something new for Macgreegor to dae
that,” Lizzie quietly observed.</p>

<p>“Tits, wumman!” muttered John.</p>

<p>“Wi’ their cheap cars,” put in Mr. Purdie,
“Glesga folk are like to loss the use o’ their legs.
It’s terrible to see the number o’ young folk that
winna walk if they’ve a bawbee in their pooch.
I’m gled to see Macgreegor’s no’ yin o’ them.” He
patted Macgregor’s shoulder as he might have done
ten years ago, and the youth moved impatiently.</p>

<p>“I’m no’ complainin’ o’ Macgreegor walkin’
when he micht tak’ the car,” said Lizzie, “but I
wud like to see him puttin’ his savin’s to some guid
purpose.”</p>

<p>At these words Macgregor went a dull red, and
set down his cup with a clatter.</p>

<p>“Ha’e ye burnt yer mooth?” asked John, with
quick sympathy.</p>

<p>“Naw,” was the ungracious reply. “It’s naebody’s
business whether I tak’ the car or tramp it.
See’s the butter, Jeannie.”</p>

<p>There was a short silence. An outbreak of temper
on Macgregor’s part was not of frequent occurrence.
Then John turned the conversation to
a big fire that had taken place in Glasgow the previous
night, and the son finished his meal in silence.</p>

<p>At the earliest possible moment Macgregor left
the kitchen. For some reason or other the desire
to get away from his elders was paramount. A
few minutes later he was in the little room which
belonged to him and Jimsie. On the inside of the
door was a bolt, screwed there by himself some
months ago. He shot it now. With a towel that
hung on the door he rubbed his wet face savagely.
He had washed his hands in turpentine ere leaving
the scene of his work.</p>

<p>He donned a clean collar. As he was fixing his
Sunday tie a summons came to the door. He went
and opened it, looking cross.</p>

<p>“Weel, what are ye wantin’, Jimsie?”</p>

<p>“Did ye bring ma putty, Macgreegor?”</p>

<p>“Och, I clean forgot.”</p>

<p>Jimsie’s face fell. “Ye promised,” he complained.</p>

<p>Macgregor patted the youngster’s head. “I’ll
bring it the morn’s nicht, as sure as death,” he said.
“I’m sorry, Jimsie,” he added apologetically.</p>

<p>“See an’ no’ forget again,” said Jimsie, and retired.</p>

<p>Macgregor closed the door and attended to his
tie. Then he looked closely at his face in the mirror
hanging near the window. He was not a particularly
good-looking lad, yet his countenance
suggested nothing coarse or mean. His features
as features, however, did not concern him now.
From his vest pocket he brought a knife, with a
blade thinned by stone and polished by leather.
He tried its keen edge on his thumb, shook his
head, and applied the steel to his boot. Presently
he began to scrape his upper lip. It pained him,
and he desisted. Not for the first time he wished
he had a real razor.</p>

<p>Having put the knife away, he looked at his
watch&mdash;his grandfather’s prize for “good conduct”
of eight years ago&mdash;and proceeded hastily
to brush his hair. His hair, as his mother had
often remarked during his childhood, was “awfu’
ill to lie.” For a moment or two he regarded his
garments. He would have changed them had he
had time&mdash;or was it courage?</p>

<p>Finally he took from his pockets a key and two
pennies. He opened a drawer in the old chest, and
placed the pennies in a disused tobacco tin, which
already contained a few coins. He knew very well
the total sum therein, but he reckoned it up once
more. One shilling and sevenpence.</p>

<p>Every Saturday he handed his wages to his
mother, who returned him sixpence. His present
hoard was the result of two weeks’ abstinence from
cigarettes and walking instead of taking the car.
He knew the job in the west-end would take at least
another week, which meant another sixpence, and
the coming Saturday would bring a second sixpence.
Total in the near future:&mdash;two shillings and sevenpence.
He smiled uncertainly, and locked up the
treasure.</p>

<p>A minute later he slipped quietly into the passage
and took his cap from its peg.</p>

<p>The kitchen door opened. “Whaur are ye gaun,
Macgreegor?” his mother asked.</p>

<p>“Oot,” he replied briefly, and went. Going
down the stairs he felt sorry somehow. Sons often
feel sorry somehow, but mothers may never know it.</p>

<p>When Lizzie, hiding her hurt, had shut the
kitchen door, Mr. Purdie said softly: “That
question an’ that answer, ma dear, are as auld as
human natur’.”</p>

<p class="center">&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;</p>

<p>As Macgregor turned out of the tenement close
he encountered his one-time chum, Willie Thomson.
Macgregor might not have admitted it to his parents,
but during the last few weeks he had been
finding Willie’s company less and less desirable.</p>

<p>Willie now put precisely the same question that
Mrs. Robinson had put a minute earlier.</p>

<p>“I’ll maybe see ye later,” was Macgregor’s
evasive response, delivered awkwardly. He passed
on.</p>

<p>“Ha’e ye a ceegarette on ye?” cried Willie, taking
a step after him.</p>

<p>“Na.”</p>

<p>“Ye’re in a queer hurry.”</p>

<p>“I’ll maybe see ye later,” said Macgregor again,
increasing his speed in a curious guilty fashion.</p>

<p>Willie made no attempt to overtake him. He,
too, had been finding a certain staleness in the old
friendship&mdash;especially since Macgregor had
stopped his purchases of cigarettes. Willie was as
often out of employment as in it, but he did not
realise that he was in danger of becoming a mere
loafer and sponge. Yet he was fond of Macgregor.</p>

<p>Macgregor passed from the quiet street wherein
he lived into one of Glasgow’s highways, aglow
with electric light, alive with noise out of all proportion
to its traffic. He continued to walk swiftly,
his alert eyes betraying his eagerness, for the distance
of a couple of blocks. Then into another
quiet street he turned, and therein his pace became
slower and slower, until it failed altogether. Beneath
a gas lamp he questioned his watch, his expression
betokening considerable anxiety.</p>

<p>It was a fine October night, but chilly&mdash;not that
he gave any sign of feeling cold. For a space he
remained motionless, gazing up the street. Possibly
he would have liked a cigarette just then.</p>

<p>As though rousing himself, he moved abruptly
and proceeded slowly to the next lamp post, turned
about and came back to his first halting-place, where
he turned about again. For a long half-hour he
continued to stroll between the two posts. Few
persons passed him, and he did not appear to notice
them. Indeed, it may as well be frankly admitted
that he shamefully avoided their glances. When
at last he did stop, it was with a sort of jerk.</p>

<p>From one of the closes a girl emerged and came
towards him.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">CHAPTER TWO</h3>
<hr />
<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Macgregor’s</span> acquaintance with Jessie Mary was
almost as old as himself; yet only within the last
three months had he recognised her existence as
having aught of importance to do with his own.
This recognition had followed swift on the somewhat
sudden discovery that Jessie Mary was pretty.</p>

<p>The discovery was made at a picnic, organised by
a section of the great drapery store wherein Jessie
Mary found employment, Macgregor’s presence at
the outing being accounted for by the fact that in a
weak moment he had squandered a money gift
from his grandparents on the purchase of two
tickets for Katie, his first love (so far as we
know), and himself. The picnic was a thorough
success, but neither Macgregor nor Katie enjoyed
it. It was not so much that anything came between
them, as that something that had been between
them departed&mdash;evaporated. There was no
quarrel; merely a dulness, a tendency to silence, increasing
in dreariness as the bright day wore on.
And, at last, in the railway compartment, on the
way home, they sat, crushed together by the crowd,
Katie dumb with dismay, Macgregor steeped in
gloom.</p>

<p>Opposite them sat Jessie Mary and her escort, a
young man with sleek hair, a pointed nose, several
good teeth, and a small but exquisite black moustache.
These two were gay along with the majority
of the occupants of the carriage. Perhaps in
her simple sixteen-year-old heart Katie began to
realise that she was deserted indeed; perhaps Macgregor
experienced prickings of shame, not that he
had ever given or asked promises. Still, it is to
be hoped that he did not remember then any of
Katie’s innocent little advances of the past.</p>

<p>Affection ’twixt youth and youth is such a delicate,
sensitive thing, full of promise as the pretty
egg of a bonny bird, and as easily broken.</p>

<p>Macgregor was caught by the vivacious dark
eyes of Jessie Mary, snared by her impudent red
mouth, held by the charm of her face, which the
country sun had tinted with an unwonted bloom.
Alas for the little brown mouse at his side! At
briefer and briefer intervals he allowed his gloomy
glance to rest on the girl opposite, while he became
more and more convinced that the young man
with the exquisite moustache was a “bletherin’
idiot.” Gradually he shifted his position to the
very edge of the seat, so as to lessen his contact
with Katie. And when Jessie Mary, without
warning, presented to his attention her foot in its
cheap, stylish shoe, saying: “I wish ye wud tie
ma lace, Macgreegor,” a strange wild thrill of pride
ran through his being, though, to be sure, he went
scarlet to the ears and his fingers could scarce perform
their office. There were friends of Jessie
Mary who declared that Macgregor never would
have noticed her at all that day had she not been
wearing a white frock with a scarlet belt; but that
was grossly unfair to Jessie Mary. The animation
and fresh coquetry of eighteen were also hers.</p>

<p>Nigh three months had gone, autumn had come,
and here in a dingy side-street the captivated youth
had lingered on the bare chance of a glimpse of the
same maiden in her every-day attire, his mind tormented
by his doubts as to his reception, should she
happen to appear.</p>

<p class="center">&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;</p>

<p>And now she was approaching him. For the
life of him he could neither advance nor retire.
Still, such of his wits as had remained faithful informed
him that it was “stupid-like” to do nothing
at all. Whereupon he drew out his watch and appeared
to be profoundly interested in the time. At
the supreme moment of encounter his surprise was,
it must be confessed, extremely badly managed, and
he touched his cap with the utmost diffidence and
without a word.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” Jessie Mary remarked carelessly.
“Fancy meetin’ you, as the man said to the sassige
roll!”</p>

<p>It had been a mutton-pie at their last meeting,
Macgregor remembered, trying to laugh. Some
comfort might have been his had he known that
this flippancy, or its variant, was her form of greeting
to all the young men then enjoying her acquaintance.
Jessie Mary usually kept a joke going
for about three months, and quite successfully, too.</p>

<p>“Did ye no’ expec’ to meet me?” He stumbled
over the words.</p>

<p>Jessie Mary laughed lightly, mockingly. “I
wasna aware yer best girl lived in this street.”</p>

<p>“It&mdash;it’s no’ the first time ye’ve seen me here,”
he managed to say.</p>

<p>She laughed again. “Weel, that’s true. I wonder
wha the girl is.” He would have told her if he
could, poor boy. “But I must hurry,” she went on,
“or the shops’ll be shut.”</p>

<p>“Can I no’ gang wi’ ye?” he asked, with a great
effort.</p>

<p>“Oh, ye can come as far as Macrorie’s,” she
answered graciously, mentioning a provision shop.</p>

<p>Young love is ever grateful for microscopic
mercies, and Macgregor’s spirit took courage as he
fell into step with her. Jessie Mary was a handsomely
built young woman; her shoulder was quite
on a level with his. There were times when he
would fain have been taller; times, also, when
he would fain have been older, for Jessie Mary’s
years exceeded his own by two. Nevertheless, he
was now thinking of her age without reference to
his own. He was, in fact, about to speak of it,
when Jessie Mary said:</p>

<p>“I’m to get to the United Ironmongers’ dance
on Friday week, after a’. When fayther was at
his tea the nicht, he said I could gang.”</p>

<p>She might as well have poured a jug of ice
water over him. “Aw, did he?” he murmured
feebly.</p>

<p>“Ye should come, Macgreegor,” she continued.
“Only three-an’-six for a ticket admittin’ lady an’
gent.”</p>

<p>“Och, I’m no’ heedin’ aboot dancin’,” said Macgregor,
knowing full well that his going was out
of the question.</p>

<p>“It’ll be a splendid dance. They’ll keep it up
till three,” she informed him.</p>

<p>With his heart in his mouth he enquired who was
taking her to the dance.</p>

<p>“Oh, I ha’ena decided yet.” She gave her head
a becoming little toss. “I’ve several offers. I’ll
let them quarrel in the meantime.”</p>

<p>Perhaps it was some consolation to know that she
had not decided on any particular escort, and that
the rivals were at war with one another. While
there is strife there is hope.</p>

<p>“Ay; ye’ll ha’e plenty offers,” he managed to
say steadily, and felt rather pleased with himself.</p>

<p>“I’m seriously thinking o’ wearin’ pink,” she
told him as they turned into the main street. “It’s
maybe a wee thing common, but I’ve been told it
suits me.”</p>

<p>Macgregor wondered who had told her, and
stifling his jealousy, observed that pink was a bonny
colour.... “But&mdash;but ye wud look fine in ony
auld thing.” Truly he was beginning to get on.</p>

<p>So, at least, Jessie Mary seemed to think.
“Nane o’ yer flattery!” she said with a coquettish
laugh.</p>

<p>“I wud like fine to see ye at the dance,” he said
with a sigh.</p>

<p>“Come&mdash;an’ I’ll gi’e ye a couple o’ dances&mdash;three,
if I can spare them.” Hitherto Jessie Mary
had regarded Macgregor as a mere boy, and sometimes
as a bit of a nuisance, but she was the sort
of young woman who cannot have too many strings
to her bow. “I can get ye a ticket,” she added encouragingly.</p>

<p>For an instant it occurred to Macgregor to ask
her to let him take her to the dance&mdash;he would find
the money somehow&mdash;but the idea died in its
birth. He could not both go to the dance and do
that which he had already promised himself to do.
Besides, she might laugh at him and refuse.</p>

<p>“It’s nae use speakin’ aboot the dance,” he said
regretfully. Then abruptly: “Yer birthday’s on
Tuesday week, is’t no’?”</p>

<p>Jessie Mary looked at him. His eyes were on
the pavement. “Wha tell’t ye that?”</p>

<p>“I heard ye speakin’ aboot yer birthday to somebody
at the picnic.”</p>

<p>“My! ye’ve a memory!”</p>

<p>“But it’s on Tuesday week&mdash;the twinty-third?
I was wantin’ to be sure.”</p>

<p>“Weel, it’s the twinty-third, sure enough.”
She heaved an affected sigh. “Nineteen! I’m
gettin’ auld, Macgreegor. Time I was gettin’ a
lad! Eh?” She laughed at his confusion of
face. “But what for d’ye want to ken aboot ma
birthday?” she innocently enquired, becoming
graver.</p>

<p>The ingenuousness of the question helped him.</p>

<p>“Aw, I jist wanted to ken, Jessie Mary. Never
heed aboot it. I hope ye’ll enjoy the dance&mdash;when
it comes.” This was quite a long speech for
Macgregor to make, but it might have been even
longer had they not just then arrived at the provision
shop.</p>

<p>“Here we are,” said she cheerfully. She had
the decency to ignore the smile of the young man
behind the counter&mdash;the young man with the sharp
nose and exquisite black moustache; nor did she
appear to notice another young man on the opposite
pavement who was also gazing quite openly
at her. “Here we are, an’ here we part&mdash;to meet
again, I hope,” she added, with a softer glance.</p>

<p>“I’ll wait till ye’ve got yer messages,” said Macgregor,
holding his ground.</p>

<p>She gave him her sweetest smile but one. “Na,
Macgreegor; it’ll tak’ me a while to get the messages,
an’ I’ve ither places to gang afterwards.
Maybe I’ll see ye floatin’ aroun’ anither nicht.”</p>

<p>“But I’m no’ in a hurry. I&mdash;I wish ye wud let
me wait.”</p>

<p>Her very sweetest smile was reserved for the
most stubborn cases, and she gave it him now. But
her voice though gentle was quite firm. “If ye
want to please me, Macgreegor, ye’ll no’ wait the
nicht.”</p>

<p>He was conquered. She nodded kindly and entered
the doorway.</p>

<p>“Guidbye, Jessie Mary,” he murmured, and
turned away.</p>

<p>There were no other customers in the shop.
Jessie Mary took a seat at the counter. The young
man, stroking his moustache, gave her a good-evening
tenderly.</p>

<p>“I’m to get to the dance,” she said, solemnly.</p>

<p>The young man’s hand fell to his side. “Wi’
me?” he cried, very eagerly.</p>

<p>“I ha’ena made up ma mind yet, Peter. I want
a pair o’ kippers&mdash;the biggest ye’ve got.”</p>

<h3 class="h3head">CHAPTER THREE</h3>
<hr />
<p class="p2"><span class="sc">The</span> outside of the shop had been painted but
recently. Above door and window were blazoned
in large gilt letters the words:</p>

<p class="center">STATIONERY <span class="sc lowercase">AND</span> FANCY GOODS.</p>

<p class="unindent">Just over the doorway was very modestly printed
in white the name of the proprietor:</p>

<p class="center sc">M. Tod.</p>

<p>What the <em>M</em> stood for nobody knew (or cared)
unless, perhaps, the person so designated; and it is
almost conceivable that she had forgotten, considering
that for five and thirty years she had never
heard herself addressed save as Miss Tod.</p>

<p>For five and thirty years M. Tod had kept her
shop without assistance. For five and thirty years
she had lived in the shop and its back room, rarely
going out of doors except to church on Sunday
mornings. The grocer along the way had a standing
order: practically all the necessaries of life, as
M. Tod understood them, could be supplied from
a grocer’s shop. A time had been when M. Tod
saved money; but the last ten years had witnessed
a steady shrinking of custom, a dwindling in hopes
for a peaceful, comfortable old age, a shrinking and
dwindling in M. Tod herself. A day came when
a friendly customer and gossip was startled to behold
M. Tod suddenly flop to the floor behind the
counter.</p>

<p>A doctor, hastily summoned, brought her back to
a consciousness of her drab existence and dingy
shop. She was soon ready to go on with both as
though nothing had happened. The doctor, however,
warned her quite frankly that if she did not
take proper nourishment, moderate exercise and
abundance of fresh air, she would speedily find
herself beyond need of these things.</p>

<p>M. Tod did not want to die, and since she never
laughed at anything she could not laugh at the
doctor. To some of us life is like a cup of bitter
physic with a lump of sugar at the bottom, but no
spoon to stir it up with; life, therefore, must be
sweet&mdash;sooner or later.</p>

<p>On the other hand, obedience to the doctor would
involve considerable personal expenditure, not to
mention the engaging of an assistant. When M.
Tod had reckoned up the remnants of her savings
and estimated her financial position generally, she
incontinently groaned. Nevertheless, she presently
proceeded to prepare a two-line advertisement for
the <cite>Evening Express</cite>. She was still in the throes of
composition&mdash;endeavouring to say in twenty
words what she thought in two hundred&mdash;when
Mr. Baldwin, traveller for a firm of fancy-goods
merchants, entered the shop. Acquainted with his
kindly manner in the past, she ventured to confide
to him her present difficulties.</p>

<p>Mr. Baldwin was not only sympathetic but helpful.</p>

<p>“Why,” said he, “my niece Christina might suit
you&mdash;in fact, I’m sure she would. She is nearly
sixteen, and only yesterday finished a full course of
book-keeping. More than that, Miss Tod, she has
had experience in the trade. Her aunt before her
marriage to&mdash;er&mdash;myself&mdash;had a little business
like your own, at the coast. I had thought of getting
Christina a situation in the wholesale, but I
believe it would be better for her to be here, for a
time at least. I know she is keen on a place where
she can have her own way&mdash;I mean to say, have
room to carry out her own ideas.” Mr. Baldwin
halted in some confusion, but speedily recovered.
“Anyway,” he went on, “give her a trial. Let me
send her along to see you this evening.”</p>

<p>M. Tod assented, possibly because she feared to
hurt the traveller’s feelings. “Nearly sixteen”
and “keen on a place where she can have her own
way” did not sound precisely reassuring to the old
woman who had no experience of young folk, and
who had been her own mistress for so long.</p>

<p>That evening Christina came, saw and, after a
little hesitation, conquered her doubts as to the suitability
of the situation. “I’ll manage her easy,”
she said to herself while attending with the utmost
demureness to M. Tod’s recital of the duties required
of her assistant&mdash;“I’ll manage her easy.”</p>

<p>Within six months she had made good her unuttered
words.</p>

<p class="center">&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;</p>

<p>It was Saturday afternoon. M. Tod was about
to leave the shop for an airing. Time takes back
no wrinkles, yet M. Tod seemed younger than a
year ago. She had lost the withered, yellowed
complexion of those who worship continually in
the Temple of Tannin; her movements were freer;
her voice no longer fell at the end of every sentence
on a note of hopelessness. Though she had grown
some months older, she had become years less
aged. She glanced round her shop with an air of
pride.</p>

<p>From behind the counter Christina, with a
kindly, faintly amused smile, watched her.</p>

<p>“Ay,” remarked M. Tod, “everything looks
vera nice&mdash;vera nice, indeed, dearie. I can see
ye’ve done yer best to follow ma instructions.”</p>

<p>It had become a habit with M. Tod to express
observations of this sort prior to going out, a habit,
also, to accept all Christina’s innovations and improvements
as originally inspired by herself.
Even the painting of the shop, which, when first
mooted by the girl, had seemed about as desirable
as an earthquake, had gradually become her very
own bright idea. Happily Christina had no difficulty
in tolerating such gentle injustices; as a matter
of fact, she preferred that her mistress should
be managed unawares.</p>

<p>“Tak’ a squint at the window when ye gang oot,”
she said, pleasantly. “Ye ha’ena seen it since it
was dressed. There’s a heap o’ cheap trash in it,
but it’s trash that draws the public noo-a-days.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wudna say that, dearie,” said the old
woman. “I’ve aye tried to gi’e folk guid value.”</p>

<p>“Ay! Ma aunt was like that&mdash;near ruined
hersel’ tryin’ to gi’e the public what it didna want.
What the public wants is gorgeousness&mdash;an’ it
wants it cheap. Abyssinian Gold an’ papermashy
leather an’ so on. See thon photo-frames!”&mdash;Christina
pointed&mdash;“the best sellin’ photo-frames
ever we had! In a week or so, they get wearit
sittin’ on the mantel-piece, an’ doon they fa’ wi’ a
broken leg; in a fortnight they look as if they had
been made in the year ten B.C.! Behold thon
purses! Safer to carry yer cash in a paper poke,
but the public canna resist the real, <em>genuine</em> silver
mounts. Observe <span class="lock">thon&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Weel, weel,” Miss Tod mildly interrupted,
“it’s maybe as ye say, an’ I canna deny that custom’s
improvin’. But it’s a sad pity that folk
winna buy the <span class="lock">best&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Oh, let the folk pity theirsel’s&mdash;when they get
sense&mdash;an’ that’ll no’ be this year. Gi’e them what
they want, an’ never heed what they need. That’s
the motto for a shop-keeper. Come ower here for
a minute till I sort yer bonnet, or ye’ll be lossin’
twa o’ yer grapes. I hear figs an’ onions is to be
the favourite trimmin’ next Spring. Ye could dae
wi’ a new bonnet, Miss Tod.”</p>

<p>“So I could,” the old woman wistfully admitted
as she submitted her headgear to her assistant’s
deft fingers. “I couldna say when I got this yin.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m no’ keen on dates. But”&mdash;encouragingly&mdash;“we’ll
tak’ stock next week, an’ when
we’ve struck the half-year’s balance I’ll no’ be surprised
if ye tak’ the plunge an’ burst a pound-note
at the milliner’s.” Christina administered a final
pat to the ancient bonnet. “Noo ye’re ready for
the road. See an’ no’ catch cold. I’ll ha’e the
kettle at the bile against yer return at five.”</p>

<p>“I’ll no’ be late,” replied M. Tod who, to tell the
truth, was already wishing it were tea-time, and
moved to the door.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said Christina, “ye wudna care to
call at the Reverend Mr. McTavish’s an’ politely
ask for payment o’ his account&mdash;consistin’ chiefly
o’ sermon-paper. He’s a whale for sermon-paper!”</p>

<p>“Oh, dearie, dearie, I couldna dae that,” faltered
M. Tod, and made her escape.</p>

<p>“If that account isna paid sune,” Christina murmured,
“I’ll ha’e to gang masel’ an’ put the fear o’
death into the man. Business is business&mdash;even
when it’s releegious.”</p>

<p>She looked round the shop to discover if aught
required her attention; then being satisfied that
nought could be improved, she seated herself on
the stool and prepared to do a little book-keeping.</p>

<p>As she dipped her pen, however, the door of the
shop was slowly opened, the bell above it banged,
and a young man&mdash;so she reckoned him&mdash;came
in. In her quick way, though she had never seen
him before, she put him down in her mind as a
purchaser of a half-penny football paper. But having
recovered from the alarm of the bell and carefully
shut the door, he hesitated, surveying his surroundings.</p>

<p>Christina flung back her thick plait of fair
hair, slipped from the stool, and came to attention.</p>

<p>“Nice day,” she remarked in her best manner.
She contrived to get away from the vernacular in
her business dealings.</p>

<p>“Ay,” The young man smiled absently.</p>

<p>“Nice teeth,” thought Christina. (That Macgregor’s
teeth were good was entirely due to his
mother’s firmness in the matter of brushing them
during his younger days. He was inclined to be
proud of them now.)</p>

<p>“Just take a look round,” she said aloud.</p>

<p>Macgregor acknowledged the invitation with a
nod.</p>

<p>“Was it anything special you wanted to see?”
she enquired.</p>

<p>Macgregor regarded her for a moment. “I had
a look at yer window,” he said, his eyes wandering
once more, “but I seen naething dearer nor a
shillin’.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Christina. Then recovering
her dignity&mdash;“The window is merely a popular
display. We have plenty of more expensive goods
within.” She felt pleased at having said “within”
instead of “inside.”</p>

<p>At the word “expensive” Macgregor shrank.
“Aboot half-a-croon?” he said diffidently, taking
a step towards the door.</p>

<p>“Half-a-croon <em>and</em> upwards,” said Christina
very distinctly. As a matter of fact, the shop contained
few articles priced as high as two shillings,
the neighbourhood not being noted for its affluence;
but one of Christina’s mottoes was “First catch
your customer and then rook him.” “Oh, yes,”
she added pleasantly, “our goods at half-a-crown
are abundant.”</p>

<p>For a moment Macgregor doubted she was laughing
at him, but a veiled glance at her earnest face
reassured him&mdash;nay, encouraged him. He had
never bought a present for a lady before, and felt
his position keenly. Indeed, he had left his home
district to make the purchase in order that he might
do so unrecognised.</p>

<p>So with a shy, appealing smile he said:</p>

<p>“It’s for a present.”</p>

<p>“A present. Certainly!” she replied, lapsing a
trifle in the excitement of the moment. “Male or
female?”</p>

<p>Macgregor gave her an honest stare.</p>

<p>“Is it for a lady or gent?” she enquired, less
abashed by the stare than annoyed with herself for
having used the wrong phrase.</p>

<p>“Lady,” said Macgregor, with an attempt at
boldness, and felt himself getting hot.</p>

<p>“Will you kindly step this way?” came the polite
invitation.</p>

<p>Macgregor proceeded to the counter and bumped
his knee against the chair that stood there.</p>

<p>“Useful or ornamental?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I dinna ken,” he answered between his
teeth.</p>

<p>“I’ll break that chair’s neck for it some day!”
cried Christina, her natural sympathy for suffering
getting the better of her commercial instincts.
Then she coughed in her best style. “Do you
think the young lady would like something to
wear?”</p>

<p>“I dinna ken, I’m sure.” Macgregor pushed
back his cap and scratched his head. “Let’s see
what ye’ve got for wearin’ an’&mdash;an’ no’ for
wearin’.”</p>

<p>Christina, too, nearly scratched her head. She
was striving to think where she could lay hands on
articles for which she could reasonably charge half-a-crown.</p>

<p>Without very noticeable delay she turned to a
drawer, and presently displayed a small green oblong
box. She opened it.</p>

<p>“This is a nice fountain-pen,” she explained.
“Its price has been <span class="lock">reduced&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Aw, I’m no’ heedin’ aboot reduced things,
thank ye a’ the same.”</p>

<p>“I’ll make it two shillings to you,” Christina said
persuasively. “That’s a very drastic reduction.”
Which was perfectly true. On the other hand, the
pen was an old model which she had long despaired
of selling. “Nothing could be more suitable for a
young lady,” she added, exhibiting the nib. “Real
gold.”</p>

<p>But Macgregor shook his head.</p>

<p>With apparent cheerfulness she laid the pen aside.
“It’s for a <em>young</em> lady, I think you said?”</p>

<p>“Ay, it’s for a young lady, but she’s no’ that
young either. Aboot ma ain age, maybe.”</p>

<p>Christina nearly said “about twelve, I suppose,”
but refrained. She was learning to subdue her
tendency to chaff. “I perceive,” she said gravely.
“Is she fond of needlework?”</p>

<p>“I couldna say. She’s gettin’ a pink dress, but
I think her mither’s sewin’ it for her.”</p>

<p>“A pink dress!” muttered Christina, forgetting
herself. “Oh, Christopher Columbus!” She
turned away sharply.</p>

<p>“Eh?”</p>

<p>“She’ll be a brunette?” said Christina calmly,
though her cheeks were flushed.</p>

<p>“I couldna say,” said Macgregor again.</p>

<p>Christina brought forward a tray of glittering
things. “These combs are much worn at present,”
she informed him. “Observe the jewels.”</p>

<p>“They’ll no’ be real,” said Macgregor doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;a&mdash;no. Not exactly <em>real</em>. But everybody
weers&mdash;wears imitation jewellery nowadays.
The west-end’s full of it&mdash;chock-a-block, in fact.”
She held up a pair of combs of almost blinding
beauty. “Chaste&mdash;ninepence each.”</p>

<p>“Ay,” sighed Macgregor, “but I’m no’
<span class="lock">sure&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Silver belt&mdash;quite the rage&mdash;one shilling.”</p>

<p>Macgregor remembered the scarlet belt at the
picnic. He had a vague vision of a gift of his in
its place. He held out his hand for the glittering
object.</p>

<p>“You don’t happen to know the size of the
lady’s waist?” said Christina in a most discreet
tone of voice.</p>

<p>“I couldna say.” He laid down the belt, but
kept looking at it.</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” she said softly, lifting the belt
and fastening it round her waist. She was wearing
a navy skirt and a scarlet flannel shirt, with a white
collar and black tie. “My waist is just about medium.”
She proceeded to put the combs in her
hair. “Of course they would look better on a
brunette.” She permitted herself the faintest of
smiles. “But you can see how they look when
they’re being worn.”</p>

<p>as there a hint of mockery in the bright grey-blue
eyes? Macgregor did not observe it; nor was
he shocked by the crudity and gaudiness of the
ornaments in broad daylight. But perhaps the general
effect was not so shocking. Christina, having
previously experimented with the ornaments, had
a pretty good idea of how they appeared upon her.
It would be difficult to describe precisely what Macgregor
thought just then, but it is to be feared that
he made the sudden and unexpected discovery that
Jessie Mary was not the only pretty girl in the
world.</p>

<p>“I’ll tak’ them,” he said uneasily, and put his
hand in his pocket.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Christina. “Will that be
all to-day?”</p>

<p>“Ay; that’ll be a’.” He had purposed spending
the odd penny of his fund on a birthday card, but
for some undefinable reason let the coin fall back
into his pocket.</p>

<p>Christina proceeded to make a neat parcel.
“You’re a stranger here,” she remarked pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Ay. But I dinna live far awa’.” Now that
the ordeal was over, he was feeling more at ease.
“Ye’ve a nice shop, miss.”</p>

<p>“Do you think so? I’m very glad you got
something to suit you in it. Thank you! Half-a-crown&mdash;two-and-six
exactly. <em>Good</em> afternoon!”</p>

<p>It may be that Macgregor would have stopped to
make a remark or two on his own account, but
just then an elderly woman entered the shop.</p>

<p>“Guidbye, Miss,” he murmured, touching his
cap, and departed with his purchase.</p>

<p>Christina dropped the silver into the till. To
herself she said: “I doobt he’s no’ as green as
he’s cabbage-lookin’.” Aloud: “Nice day, Mrs.
Dunn. Is your little grandson quite well again?”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<hr class="linebox" />
<h3 class="h3head">CHAPTER FOUR</h3>
<hr />
<p class="p2"><span class="sc">For</span> some weeks Macgregor had nourished an
idea of making the birthday presentation with his
own hands. In fancy he had beheld his own gallant
proffering of the gifts, and Jessie Mary’s shy
acceptance of the same. Why he should have
foreseen himself bold and Jessie Mary bashful is
a question that may be left to those who have the
profound insight necessary to diagnose the delicate
workings of a youthful and lovelorn imagination.
At the same time he had harboured many hopeful
fears and fearful hopes, but to divulge these in detail
would be sacrilege.</p>

<p>On the day following the purchase of the gifts,
however, his original plan, so simple and straightforward,
would seem to have lost something of its
attractiveness. Perhaps he was suddenly assailed
by the cowardice of modesty; possibly he argued,
in effect, that the offering would gain in importance
by impersonal delivery. At all events, he endeavoured,
on the way to church, to borrow from Willie
Thomson the sum of threepence&mdash;the charge for
delivery demanded by a heartless post-office. Unfortunately
Willie’s finances just then were in a
most miserable state, so much so that on this very
morning he had been compelled to threaten his
aunt, with whom and on whom he lived, with the
awful vow never to enter a church again unless she
supplied him with twopence on the spot. (This,
of course, in addition to the customary penny for
“the plate.”)</p>

<p>He jingled the coins in his pocket while he confided
to Macgregor his tale of a hard world, and
continued to do so while he waited for the sympathy
which past experience of his friend led him
to expect.</p>

<p>It was therefore something of a shock to Willie
when Macgregor, privately fondling the penny
which he had not spent on a birthday card, replied:
“I could manage wi’ the tuppence, Wullie. An’
I’ll pay ye back on Seturday, sure.”</p>

<p>“Eh?” Willie stopped jingling and clutched
his coins tightly.</p>

<p>Macgregor repeated his words hopefully.</p>

<p>“Aw, but I canna len’ ye the tuppence,” said
Willie, almost resentfully; adding, “But I’ll gi’e
ye a ceegarette or twa when I buy some.”</p>

<p>“I’m no’ wantin’ yer ceegarettes,” Macgregor returned,
his eyes on the pavement.</p>

<p>Willie shot at him a curious glance. “What for
d’ye want the tuppence? Ha’e ye been bettin’ on
horses?”</p>

<p>For a moment Macgregor was tempted to plead
guilty of that or any other crime on the chance of
gaining the other’s sympathies and pence. Instead,
however, he answered with caution: “I’ll maybe
tell ye, if ye’ll len’ me the tuppence.”</p>

<p>Willie laughed. “I’m no’ sae green. Ye best
get yer fayther to gi’e ye the money.”</p>

<p>“Clay up!” snapped Macgregor, and remained
silent for the rest of the journey.</p>

<p>Had the money been required for any other object
in the world, Macgregor would probably have
gone straightway to his father and frankly asked
for it. But the limits of confidence between son
and parent are reached when the subject is a girl.
Nevertheless, it was to the boy’s credit that he
never dreamed of attempting to obtain his father’s
help under false pretences.</p>

<p>That night he came to the dismal decision to
deliver the package himself at Jessie Mary’s door,
at an hour when Jessie Mary would be certain to
be out. There was nothing else for it, as far as
he could see just then.</p>

<p>The following morning’s light found him at his
work&mdash;no longer, alas! in the far west-end with
its windfall of pennies for the car, but in the heart
of the city. The man under whom he worked
found him so slow and stupid that he threatened to
report him to his employer. Altogether it was a
dreary day, and Macgregor, who usually paid
enough attention to his duties to escape the burden
of time, was more than glad when the last working
hour had dragged to its close.</p>

<p>He went home by an unaccustomed though not
entirely unfamiliar route. It led him past the shop
wherein he had made the birthday purchases on
Saturday afternoon. The window was more
brightly illuminated than the majority of its neighbours;
the garish contents were even more attractive
than in daylight. Macgregor found himself
regarding them with a half-hearted interest.
Presently he noticed that one of the sliding glass
panels at the back of the window was open a few
inches. This aperture permitted him to see the following:
A hand writing a letter on a sloping desk,
a long plait of fair hair over a scarlet shoulder,
and a youthful profile with an expression very much
in earnest yet cheerful withal.</p>

<p>Macgregor could not help watching the writer,
and he continued to do so for several minutes with
increasingly lively interest. He was even wondering
to whom the letter might be written, when the
writer, having dipped her pen too deeply, made a
horrid, big blot. She frowned and for an instant
put out her tongue. Then, having regarded the
blot for a space with a thoughtful gaze, she seized
the pen and with a few deft touches transformed
the blot into the semblance of a black beetle.
Whereupon she smiled with such transparent delight
that Macgregor smiled also.</p>

<p>“What are ye grinnin’ at?” said a voice at his
elbow.</p>

<p>He turned to discover Willie Thomson. At no
time in the whole course of their friendship had he
felt a keener desire to hit Willie on his impudent
nose. “Naething,” he muttered shortly. “Are
ye gaun hame?”</p>

<p>“Ay,” said Willie, noting the other’s discomposure,
but not referring to it directly. “This isna
yer usual road hame.”</p>

<p>“Depends whaur I’m comin’ frae,” returned
Macgregor, quickening his pace. “Ha’e ye got a
job yet, Wullie?” he enquired more graciously.</p>

<p>“I tried yin the day, but it’s no’ gaun to suit me.
But I’ve earned ninepence. I can len’ ye thon
thruppence, if ye like.”</p>

<p>“Aw, I’m no’ needin’ it noo.”</p>

<p>“Weel, ha’e a ceegarette.” Willie produced a
yellow packet.</p>

<p>“Na, I’m no’ smokin’, Wullie.”</p>

<p>“What’s wrang wi’ ye?”</p>

<p>“Naething.... What sort of job was ye
tryin’?”</p>

<p>Willie told him, and thereafter proceeded to recount
as many grievances as there had been hours in
his working day. Macgregor encouraged him to
enter into all sorts of detail, so that home was
reached without reference to the shop window
which had caused him amusement.</p>

<p>“So long,” said Willie, lighting a fresh cigarette.
“Maybe see ye later.”</p>

<p>“Ah, it’s likely,” Macgregor replied, and turned
into the close, glad to escape.</p>

<p>“Haud on!” cried Willie.</p>

<p>“What?” Macgregor halted with reluctance.</p>

<p>Willie sniggered. “I seen ye wi’ Jessie Mary
the ither nicht.”</p>

<p>“Did ye?” retorted Macgregor feebly.</p>

<p>“Ay; an’ if I was you, I wud let girls alane.
They’re nae fun, an’ they’re awfu’ expensive.”</p>

<p>With which sage advice Willie walked off.</p>

<p>Macgregor made up his mind not to leave the
house that evening, yet eight o’clock found him at
the foot of the street wherein Jessie Mary lived.
But he did not go up the street, and at the end of
five minutes he strolled the way he had taken two
hours earlier. As he approached a certain shop the
light in its window went out. He marched home
quickly, looking neither right nor left.</p>

<p class="center">&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;</p>

<p>On the following evening he hired a small boy
for the sum of one halfpenny to deliver the package
to Jessie Mary at her abode, and straightway returned
to the parental fireside, where he blushed at
the welcome accorded him.</p>

<p>That night, however, fate willed it that John
Robinson should run out of tobacco. Macgregor,
who had been extremely restless, expressed himself
ready to step down to the tobacco shop in the main
street.</p>

<p>Here it must be mentioned that the gifts had
reached Jessie Mary at precisely the right moment.
They had raised her spirits from the depths of despair
to at least the lower heights of hope. Only an
hour before their arrival she had learned how the
young man with the exquisite moustache had
treacherously invited another young lady to accompany
him to the Ironmongers’ dance; and although
to the ordinary mind this may appear to have been
the simple result of a lack of superhuman patience
on the young man’s part, Jessie Mary could perceive
in it nothing but the uttermost perfidy. So
that until the arrival of Macgregor’s present&mdash;“to
J. M. from M. with best wishes” (an “l” had
been scraped out where the second “w” now
stood)&mdash;she had felt like tearing the pink frock
to tatters and preparing for the tomb.</p>

<p class="center">&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;</p>

<p>They met near the tobacconist’s&mdash;on Macgregor’s
home side, by the way&mdash;and he could not
have looked more guilty had he sent her an infernal
machine.</p>

<p>“It was awful kind o’ ye,” she said sweetly;
“jist <em>awful</em> kind.”</p>

<p>“Aw, it was naething,” he stammered.</p>

<p>“They’re jist lovely, an’ that fashionable,” she
went on, and gradually led the conversation to the
subject of the United Ironmongers’ dance.</p>

<p>“Ye should come,” she said, “an’ see hoo nice I
look wi’ them on. The belt’ll be lovely wi’ ma pink
frock. An’ the combs was surely made for black
hair like mines. Of course I tried them on the
minute I got them.”</p>

<p>“Did ye?” murmured Macgregor. Where was
all the feverish joy, the soft rapture anticipated
three nights ago? “Did ye?”&mdash;that was all he
said.</p>

<p>She made allowance for his youth and the bashfulness
she had so often experienced. “Macgreegor,”
she whispered, slipping her hand through
his arm, in the darkness of the street leading to her
home, “Macgreegor, I believe I wud suner dance
wi’ you than onybody else.”</p>

<p>Macgregor seemed to have nothing to say. The
touch of her hand was pleasant, and yet he was
uneasy.</p>

<p>“Macgreegor,” she said presently, a little breathlessly,
“I’m no’ heedin’ aboot ony o’ the chaps that
wants to tak’ me to the dance. If ye had a
ticket&mdash;&mdash;” She paused. They had halted in the
close-mouth, as it is locally termed. “I’m sayin’,
Macgreegor, if ye had a ticket&mdash;&mdash;” She paused
again.</p>

<p>The boy felt foolish and wretched. “But I
canna gang to the dance, Jessie Mary,” he managed
to say.</p>

<p>She leaned closer to him. “It’ll be a splendid
dance&mdash;at least”&mdash;she looked at him boldly&mdash;“it
wud be splendid if you and me was gaun thegether.”</p>

<p>In his wildest of wild dreams he may have
thought of kissing this girl. He might have done
it now&mdash;quite easily.</p>

<p>But he didn’t&mdash;he couldn’t.</p>

<p>“Na; I canna gang,” he said. “An’&mdash;an’ ma
fayther’ll be waitin’ for his tobacco. Guidnicht.”
He glanced at her with a miserable smile, and departed&mdash;bolted.</p>

<p>Poor Jessie Mary with her little natural vanities!</p>

<p>Poor Macgregor! He went home hot and
ashamed&mdash;he could not have told why. He did
not grudge the gifts, yet vaguely wished he had not
given them.</p>

<p>And he dreamed that night of, among other queer
things, a shop window, a plait of fair hair on a
scarlet shoulder, and a black beetle.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">CHAPTER FIVE</h3>
<hr />
<p class="p2"><span class="sc">“Mercy</span>, laddie!” exclaimed Mrs. Robinson, as
her son entered the kitchen, a little late for tea.
“What ha’e ye been daein’ to yer face?”</p>

<p>The colour induced by the question seemed
almost to extinguish the hectic spot at Macgregor’s
left cheek-bone.</p>

<p>“Washin’ it,” he answered shortly, taking his
accustomed chair.</p>

<p>“But it’s cut.”</p>

<p>“Tits, Lizzie!” muttered Mr. Robinson. “Are
ye for toast, Macgreegor?”</p>

<p>“He’s been shavin’ his whiskers,” said Jimsie.
“Did ye no’ ken Macgreegor’s gettin’ whiskers,
Maw?” he went on in spite of a warning pressure
from sister Jeannie. “Paw, what way dae folk
get whiskers?”</p>

<p>“Dear knows,” returned his father briefly.
“Lizzie, can ye no’ gi’e Macgreegor a cup o’ tea?”</p>

<p>Lizzie lifted the cosy from the brown teapot.
“Where did ye get the razor, Macgreegor?”</p>

<p>“He hasna got a razor, Maw,” said Jimsie.
“He does it wi’ a wee knife.”</p>

<p>“Shurrup!” Macgreegor growled, whereupon
Jimsie choked and his eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>“Macgreegor,” said his mother, “that’s no’ the
way to speak to yer wee brither.”</p>

<p>“Macgreegor,” said his sister, “I’ll mak’ ye a bit
o’ hot toast, if ye like.”</p>

<p>“Ay, Jeannie,” said John quickly, “mak’ him
a bit o’ hot toast, an’ I’ll look after Jimsie.” He
turned the conversation to the subject of a great
vessel that had been launched into the Clyde that
morning.</p>

<p>Sullenly Macgregor took the cup from his
mother’s hand and forthwith devoted his attention
to his meal. Seldom had resentment taken such
possession of his soul. Another word from his
mother or Jimsie, and he would have retorted
violently and flung out of the room. The mild intervention
of his sister and father had saved a
scene. Though his face cooled, his heart remained
hot; though hungry, he ate little, including the
freshly made toast, which he accepted with a gracelessness
that probably shamed him even more than
it hurt Jeannie. Poor sensitive, sulky youth!&mdash;a
hedge-hog with its skin turned outside-in could not
suffer more.</p>

<p>For the first time in the course of his married
life John Robinson really doubted Lizzie’s discretion.
It was with much diffidence, however, that
he referred to the matter after Macgregor had
gone out, and while Jeannie was superintending
Jimsie’s going to bed.</p>

<p>“Lizzie,” he began, eyeing his cold pipe, “did
ye happen to notice that Macgreegor was a wee
thing offended the nicht?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Robinson did not halt in her business of
polishing a bread plate. “Macgreegor’s gettin’
ower easy offended,” she said, carelessly enough.</p>

<p>John struck a match and held it without application
to his pipe until the flame scorched his hardened
fingers. “Speakin’ frae experience,” he said
slowly, “there’s twa things that a young man tak’s
vera serious-like. The <span class="lock">first&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Wha’s the young man?”</p>

<p>“Macgreegor.... Aw, Lizzie!”</p>

<p>“Macgreegor’s a laddie.”</p>

<p>“He’s a young man&mdash;an’ fine ye ken it, wife!”</p>

<p>Lizzie put down the plate and took up another.
“An’ what does he tak’ serious-like?” she
enquired, coolly.</p>

<p>“Firstly,” said John, with a great effort, and
stuck.</p>

<p>“Ye’ll be preachin’ a sermon directly,” said she.
“Can ye no’ licht yer pipe an’ speak nateral?”</p>

<p>“Hoo can I speak nateral when I ken ye’re
makin’ a mock o’ me?”</p>

<p>“Havers, man!” she said, becoming good-humoured
lest he should lose his temper; “licht yer
pipe. I’m listenin’.”</p>

<p>John lit his pipe in exceedingly methodical
fashion. “Weel, Lizzie,” he began at last, “I jist
wanted to say that when a young man’s gettin’ hair
on his face, ye&mdash;ye shouldna notice it.”</p>

<p>“I didna notice it.”</p>

<p>“Weel, ye shouldna refer to it.”</p>

<p>“It was the cut I referred to.”</p>

<p>John sucked at his pipe and scratched his head.
“That’s true,” he admitted. “Still, if yer sister
had a wudden leg, ye wudna refer to the noise on
the stair. It wasna like ye, Lizzie, to hurt Macgreegor’s
feelin’s.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Robinson put down the plate with an unusual
clatter. Hurt Macgreegor’s feelings!&mdash;She?&mdash;The
idea! “Are ye feenished?” she snapped.</p>

<p>John nerved himself. “There’s anither thing
that it’s best no’ to refer to&mdash;anither thing that a
young man tak’s vera serious-like. When a young
man begins to tak’ an interest in the <span class="lock">lassies&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Oh, man, can ye no stop haverin’?” she cried.
“Ha’e ye forgot the laddie’s age?”</p>

<p>“It’s the shavin’ age, an’ that <span class="lock">means&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Ma brither Rubbert was nineteen afore he put
a razor to his face.”</p>

<p>“Yer brither Rubbert was never what I wud
ca’ a female fancier. Of course that wasna his
fau’t; he was jist as the Lord made him, and he’s
turned oot a vera successful man, an’ for a’ we ken
his wife Sarah’s maybe better nor she’s bonny.
But yer son <span class="lock">Macgreegor&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Macgreegor wud never look at the lassies.
He’s ower shy.”</p>

<p>“Whiles it’s the kind that doesna look that leaps
the furdest. But there’s waur things in the world
nor razors and lassies,” said John, with a feeble
laugh, “an’ I jist wanted to warn ye no’ to ask
questions, even though ye should see Macgreegor
weerin’ his Sunday tie every nicht in the week! I
hope ye’re no’ offended, Lizzie.”</p>

<p>But it is to be feared that Lizzie was offended
just then. She had not been the better half for
eighteen years without knowing it; she had grown
to expect her easy-going husband’s cheerful acquiescence
in practically all she did, and to regard
her acceptance of his most mild remonstrances as
a sort of favour. And now he was actually giving
her advice concerning her treatment of her firstborn!
It was too much for her pride.</p>

<p>She set her mouth in a hard line, threw up her
head, and proceeded with her polishing.</p>

<p>John waited for a couple of minutes, then sighed
and took up his evening paper.</p>

<p class="center">&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile Macgregor was having his troubles.
He contrived to dodge Willie Thomson, who nowadays
seemed always to be where he was not
wanted, but the operation involved a <em>detour</em> of
nearly a quarter of a mile, in the course of which
he was held up by another youth of his acquaintance.
Ten minutes were wasted in listening with
ill-concealed impatience to fatuous observations
on the recent play of certain professional footballers,
and then he continued his journey only to
fall, metaphorically speaking, into the arms of
Jessie Mary emerging from a shop.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Mac! I thought ye was deid!” was
her blithe greeting, the “sausage roll” phrase
having at long last served its day. “Ye’re in a
hurry,” she added, “but so am I, so ye can walk
back to the corner wi’ me.”</p>

<p>Macgregor mumbled something to the effect that
he was in no special hurry, and, possibly in order
to give a touch of truth to his falsehood, turned
and accompanied her.</p>

<p>“Ye’ve no’ been gi’ein’ the girls a treat lately,”
she remarked. “I ha’ena noticed ye floatin’
aroun’. Ha’e ye been keepin’ the hoose at nicht?”</p>

<p>“Whiles,” he replied, and enquired with some
haste, “Hoo did ye enjoy the dance last week,
Jessie?”</p>

<p>“Oh, dinna mention it!” she cried, with a toss
of her head. “I didna gang to it.”</p>

<p>“Ye didna gang to the dance!”</p>

<p>“If I had went, it wud ha’e meant bloodshed,”
she impressively informed him. “Ye see, there
was twa chaps implorin’ me to gang wi’ them, an’
they got that fierce aboot it that I seen it wudna
ha’e been safe to gang wi’ either. A riot in a
ballroom is no’ a nice thing. An’ if I had went wi’
a third party, it wud ha’e been as much as <em>his</em> life
was worth. So I jist bided at hame.”</p>

<p>Macgregor began, but was not allowed to complete,
a sympathetic remark.</p>

<p>“Oh, I was glad I didna gang. The dance
turned oot to be a second-rate affair entirely&mdash;no’
half-a-dizzen shirt fronts in the comp’ny. An’ I
believe there wasna three o’ the men could dance
for nuts, an’ the refreshments was rotten.”</p>

<p>They had now reached the appointed corner.</p>

<p>“Jist as weel ye didna gang, then,” absently said
Macgregor, halting.</p>

<p>“Come up to the close,” said Jessie Mary.
“I’ve something to show ye. Ay; it was jist as
weel, as ye say. But there’s a champion dance
comin’ off on the nineteenth o’ November&mdash;the
young men o’ the hosiery department are gettin’
it up&mdash;naething second-rate aboot <em>it</em>. Ye should
come to it, Macgreegor.” She touched his arm&mdash;unintentionally
perhaps. “Plenty o’ pretty girls&mdash;though
I wudna guarantee their dancin’. I’ve
no’ decided yet wha I’ll gang wi’.” She paused.
Macgregor did not speak. “Ye see, I’m parteec’lar
wha I dance wi’,” she went on softly, “an’ I
expec’ you’re the same. Some girls are like bags
o’ flour an’ ithers are like telegraph poles, but
there’ll be few o’ that sort at the hosiery dance.
An’ onyway”&mdash;she laughed&mdash;“ye could aye fa’
back on <em>this</em> girl&mdash;eh?”</p>

<p>“I dinna think ye wud be that hard up for a
partner,” said Macgregor, suddenly stimulated by
a flash of her eyes in the lamplight. “But I’m no’
awfu’ keen on the dancin’.”</p>

<p>“Ye danced fine when ye was a wee laddie. I
mind when ye danced the Highland Fling in the
kitchen, on Hogmanay. That was the nicht I had
to kiss ye to get ye oot o’ the ring. Ye was ower
shy to kiss me. An’ you an’ Wullie Thomson
started the fightin’, because he laughed. D’ye
mind?”</p>

<p>“That’s an auld story,” he said, with embarrassment.</p>

<p>“I suppose it is,” she admitted reluctantly.
Then cheerfully: “Weel, here we are! But wait
till I let ye see something.” She halted at the mouth
of the close and began to unbutton her jacket.</p>

<p>“Ye’ve never seen the belt since ye gi’ed it to
me, Macgreegor. I weer it whiles in the evenin’.
There ye are! It looks fine, does it no’? Maybe
a wee thing wide. I could dae wi’ it an inch or twa
tighter. Feel.”</p>

<p>She took his hand and slid his fingers between
the metal and the white cotton blouse. Jessie
Mary had at least one quite admirable characteristic:
she doted on white garments and took pride
in their spotlessness. A very elemental sense for
the beautiful, yet who dare despise it? In these
grimy days purity of any kind is great gain.</p>

<p>This girl’s hunger for the homage and admiration
of the other sex was not so much abnormal as
unrestrained. Her apparent lack of modesty was
in reality a superabundance of simplicity&mdash;witness
her shallow artifices and transparent little dishonesties
which deceived few save herself and the
callowest of youths. Men “took their fun off
her.” And even Macgregor was not to be entrapped
now. There is nothing so dead as the
fallen fancy of a boy. Moreover, Macgregor was
still at the stage when a girl’s face is her whole
fortune, when the trimmest waist and the prettiest
curves are no assets whatsoever.</p>

<p>For a moment or two he fingered the belt, awkwardly,
to be sure, but with as much emotion as
though it were a dog’s collar.</p>

<p>“Ay,” he said, “ye’re ower jimp for it.” And
put his hand in his pocket.</p>

<p>Then, indeed, it was forced on Jessie Mary that
somehow her charms had failed to hold her
youngest admirer. The knowledge rankled. Yet
she carried it off fairly well.</p>

<p>“Ye’re no’ the first to tell me I’ve an extra sma’
waist,” she said, with a toss of her head. Then,
as if struck by a remembrance of some duty or
engagement: “But I’ve nae mair time to stan’
gassin’ wi’ you. So long!” She ran briskly up
the stone stair, humming a popular tune.</p>

<p>“So long,” returned Macgregor, and resumed
his interrupted journey, rather pleased than otherwise
with himself. He realised, though not in so
many words, that he had conducted himself in
more manly fashion than ever before. It did not
for a moment occur to him that he had left a big
“Why?” behind him, not only in the mind of
Jessie Mary, but in Willie Thomson’s also.</p>

<p class="center">&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;</p>

<p>His pilgrimage ended at the illuminated window
of M. Tod’s stationery and fancy goods shop.
Jingling the few coppers in his pockets, he appeared
to be deliberating a weighty problem of extensive
purchases, while, as a matter of fact, he inwardly
debated the most profitable ways of wasting a
penny. While he would now gladly have given all
he possessed&mdash;to wit, ninepence&mdash;to win a smile
from the girl with the scarlet blouse and the ripe-corn-yellow
pigtail, he was not prepared to
squander more than he could help for the benefit
of her employer. The opaque panels at the back
of the window were closed, the door of the shop
was composed chiefly of ground glass; wherefore
he had no inkling as to which person he was likely
to encounter at the receipt of custom. He was
hoping and waiting for a customer to enter the
shop, so that he might gain a glimpse of the interior
with the opening of the door, when suddenly the
lights in the window were lowered. Evidently it
was near to closing time.</p>

<p>Hastily deciding to “burst” the sum of one
penny on the purchase of a pencil&mdash;an article for
which he had more respect than use&mdash;he entered
the doorway and turned the handle. He had forgotten
the spring bell. When he pushed the door
inwards, it “struck one”&mdash;right from the
shoulder, so to speak. Who will assert that the
ordinary healthy youth has no nerves? ’Tis a
hoggishly healthy youth who does not bustle with
them. The sturdy Macgregor wavered on the
threshold; and as he wavered he heard behind him
a badly stifled guffaw.</p>

<p>Next moment a hearty push in the small of the
back propelled him into the shop. With a hot
countenance he pulled up, guessing who had pushed
him, and strove to look as if this were his usual
mode of entering a place of business. In his confusion
he missed the quick glance of the girl
seated at the desk on the window-end of the
counter. Her head was bent low over her writing.
He noticed, however, that she was wearing
a white blouse&mdash;which did not remind him of
Jessie Mary&mdash;and that she had a scarlet bow at
her neck.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir?” A mouse-like human being slipped
from the back of the shop to the middle point
of the counter. “Yes, sir?” it repeated, with an
accent on the query. The girl at the desk took no
notice.</p>

<p>Macgregor approached. “I was wantin’ a
pencil,” he said in the tone of one requesting a pint
of prussic acid.</p>

<p>“A pencil!” exclaimed the mouse-like human
being, as though she had a dim recollection of
hearing of such a thing long, long ago. “A
pencil&mdash;oh, certainly,” she added, more hopefully.</p>

<p>“Penny or ha’penny,” murmured the girl at the
desk.</p>

<p>“Penny or ha’penny?” demanded the mouse-like
human being, almost pertly.</p>

<p>Men didn’t expect change out of a penny! “A
penny yin,” said Macgregor with an attempt at
indifference. He tried to look at the girl, but
could not get his eyes higher than her elbow.</p>

<p>“A penny pencil!” The mouse-like human
being assumed an expression suitable to a person
who has just discovered the precise situation of
the North Pole, but not the Pole itself.</p>

<p>“Top drawer on your left, Miss Tod,” whispered
the girl at the desk.</p>

<p>“Quite so, Christina,” Miss Tod replied with
dignity. There were times when she might have
been accused of copying her assistant’s manners.
She opened the drawer, which was a deep one,
peered into it, groped, and brought forth three
bundles of pencils. With sudden mildness she
enquired of the girl: “These?... Those?”</p>

<p>“No; them!” said Christina, forgetting her
grammar and grabbing the third bundle. “Wait
a minute.” She slipped lightly from her stool and
gently edged M. Tod from the position at the
counter which had been familiar to the latter for
five-and-thirty years. “This,” she said to Macgregor,
laying the bundle in front of him, “is a
special line. One dozen&mdash;price threepence.”
She looked over his head in a manner suggesting
that it was quite immaterial to her whether he purchased
the dozen or faded away on the spot.</p>

<p>But he had his dignity too. Producing three
pennies from two pockets, he laid them on the
counter, took up the bundle of pencils, said
“Thank ye” to nobody in particular, and marched
out. Nor did he forget to close the door behind
him.</p>

<p>The stationer and her assistant regarded each
other for several seconds.</p>

<p>“Dae ye think,” said M. Tod slowly, “that that
young man is a newspaper reporter?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Christina, with a sniff or two of
her straight little nose.</p>

<p>“Or a pictur’ artist?” said M. Tod, conveying
the two bundles to the wrong drawer.</p>

<p>Christina, without a word, recovered them and
put them into their proper places. She mounted
her stool and whipped up a pen.</p>

<p>M. Tod sighed. “I never used to keep pencils
at that price. They canna be vera guid.”</p>

<p>“They’re rotten.”</p>

<p>“Oh, lassie!”</p>

<p>“Sell&mdash;or gang bankrupt,” said Christina with
enough bitter cynicism for twenty-one. “There’s
a penny profit on the bundle. <em>Ex</em>&mdash;cuse me.”
She dipped her pen.</p>

<p class="center">&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;</p>

<p>As Macgregor was nearing his home, a prey to
misery and wroth, a grinning face popped from a
close-mouth.</p>

<p>“Haw! haw! Macgreegor! So ye’re courtin’,
are ye?”</p>

<p>As the clock incontinently strikes when the hour
has come, so struck Macgregor. And he struck so
hard, that it was afterwards necessary he should
see Willie Thomson to the latter’s door. Alone
again, he cast the bundle of pencils into a dark
entry and made his way home.</p>

<p>His father opened the door, smiling a welcome.
“Weel, <span class="lock">Macgreegor&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“I’m wearied,” said the boy, and passed straightway
to his room and bolted the door. Jimsie was
sleeping like a log, and was, as usual, occupying
most of the bed.</p>

<p>Macgregor stood at the old chest of drawers that
served as dressing-table, his elbows planted thereon,
his face in his hands. He <em>was</em> wearied.</p>

<p>But under his tired eyes lay a small oblong package
with a covering of newspaper. The neatness
of it made him think of his mother; she had a way
of making next to nothing look something
important in a parcel.</p>

<p>Presently, wondering a little, he undid the paper.</p>

<p>It contained one of his father’s old razors.</p>

<p>Five minutes later he was enjoying a <em>real</em> shave.
The luxury was only exceeded by the importance
he felt! And only two cuts that bled worth
mentioning....</p>

<p>How one’s life may be changed in two short hours!</p>

<p>But Macgregor was still without regret for
having flung the pencils into the dark entry.</p>

<hr />
<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Circumstance</span> rather than circumspection was
accountable for the fact that Macgregor followed
the elusive, winding trail of love alone. The
tender adventures of our ’teens usually consist in
encounters between two boys and two girls; two
friends who tacitly admit that they want to meet
the girls; two friends who pretend that they do not
want to see the boys at any distance; and to sum
up, two pairs of young human beings with but a
single thought&mdash;themselves. Also it may happen,
now and then, that for lack of likelier company
Prince Charming goes hunting with Master Fathead,
while Princess Lilian Rose lays the scent
along with Miss Gooseberry, which but adds
plausibility to the assumption that neither sex has
the courage of its inclinations. For to be honest,
there is no cowardice like that of lad’s love; no
hypocrisy like that of lass’s. But, surely, you remember!
And if so it happened that in your own
day you, perforce, fared solitary to the chase, you
will sympathise all the more with the unheroic hero
of this slight record.</p>

<p>In this respect Macgregor was not fortunate in
his male friends. The oldest thereof, Willie
Thomson, openly contemned the female sex, not
omitting his aunt; the others confined their gallantries
to the breezy pastimes of pushing girls off
the sidewalk, bawling pleasantries after them, and
guffawing largely at their own wit or the feminine
<em>repartee</em>. Their finer instincts were doubtless still
dormant. The only mortals worthy of respect
were sundry more or less prominent personages
whose feet or fists were their fortunes. In these
days the adoration of the active by the inert is, one
hopes, at its zenith of inflation. Again, to put it
now in metaphor, Macgregor’s friends could do
with a brass band in scarlet uniform all the time,
but they had no use for a secret orchestra of muted
strings. All of which was perfectly natural&mdash;just
as natural as Macgregor’s inexplicable
preference for the secret orchestra. Spring comes
early or late; the calendar neither foretells nor
records its coming. A lad and a lass&mdash;how and
when and why the one first realises that the other
is more than a mere human being are questions
without answers. Well, it is a mercy that the
world still holds something that cannot be explained
away.</p>

<p>In one sense this boy was no more refined than
his neighbours; in another they were coarser than
he. Remains the fact that he followed the trail
alone&mdash;or thought he did.</p>

<p>Willie Thomson, for one, was interested. He
had been interested to the extent of grinning in
Macgregor’s early tenderness for little Katie, and
to the extent of sniggering in his friend’s bashful
pursuit of Jessie Mary. But now the interest was
that of the boy who discovers a nest just beyond
his hand and wonders what sort of eggs he will
get if, somehow, he can reach it. On the whole,
Willie resented his swollen nose and cut lip less
than the recent ill-disguised attempts to avoid his
company. The latter rankled. Truth to tell,
without Macgregor he was rather a lonely creature,
a kind of derelict. No one really wanted him.
He was not without acquaintances, shirkers like
himself; but in the congregation of loafers is no
true comradeship. Without admitting it even to
himself, he still admired the boy who had faithfully
championed his cause&mdash;not always virtuous&mdash;in
the past, whose material possessions he had
invariably shared, whose stolid sense of honour
had so often puzzled his own mischievous mind,
whose home he had envied despite a certain furtive
dread of the woman who ruled there. Altogether
it may be questioned whether Willie’s grudge was
directed against his old friend and not against that
which had caused his old friend’s defection. At
all events, he began to spare Macgregor any
necessity for dodging, and took to shadowing him
on his solitary strolls.</p>

<p>On the grey Saturday afternoon of the week
rendered so eventful by his first real shave, Macgregor
was once more standing by the window of
M. Tod’s shop. He was endeavouring to prop up
his courage with the recollection of the fact that a
fortnight ago, at the same hour as the present,
there had been no old woman behind the counter,
and with the somewhat rash deduction that no old
woman was there now.</p>

<p>He was also wondering what he could buy for a
penny without making a fool of himself. The
spending of a penny when there is absolutely
nothing one wants to buy is not quite so simple a
transaction as at first thought it may seem&mdash;unless,
of course, the shop is packed with
comestibles; and even then one may hesitate to
choose. Besides, Macgregor was obsessed by the
memory of the pencil transaction of three nights
ago. Had he but kept his head then, and confined
his purchase to a single pencil, he might now have
had a fair excuse for requiring another. At any
rate, he could have met suspicion with the explanation
that he had lost the first. But who would
believe that he had used, or lost, a whole dozen
within the brief space of three days?</p>

<p>A wretched position to be in, for nothing else in
the world of stationery was quite so natural and
easy to ask for as a pencil&mdash;unless a&mdash;&mdash; Why
had he not thought of it before?&mdash;a pen! Saved!
He would enter boldly, as one who had every right
to do so, and demand to be shown some pencils&mdash;no,
pens, of course. There were many varieties
of pens, he knew, even in small shops, so his selection
would take time&mdash;lots of time! If only he
were <em>sure</em> the old woman wasn’t there.</p>

<p>And just then the bell rang, the door of the shop
opened and closed, and the old woman herself
came out. In spite of her hat Macgregor recognised
her at once. She turned her face skywards
to make certain that it wasn’t raining, gave a
satisfied smirk, which Macgregor accepted with a
fearful start, though it was intended for the
window and its contents, and trotted up the street.</p>

<p>On the wave of relief, as it were, Macgregor
was carried from the window to the entrance. Yet
he had no sooner opened the door with its disconcerting
note of warning than he wished he had
delayed a minute or two longer. To retire,
however, was out of the question. He closed the
door as though he were afraid of wakening a
baby, and faced the counter.</p>

<p>The girl was there, and wearing the scarlet
blouse again. Laying aside the magazine which
she had just picked up, she smiled coldly and said
calmly: “Good-afternoon. Nice day after the
rain.”</p>

<p>In mentally rehearsing his entrance the previous
night Macgregor had, among other things, seen
himself raise his brand-new bowler hat. To his
subsequent shame and regret, he now omitted to
perform the little courtesy. That he should forget
his manners was perhaps even less surprising than
that he should forget the hat itself, which gripped
his head in a cruel fashion.</p>

<p>“Ay,” he said solemnly in response to the polite
greeting, and advanced to the counter.</p>

<p>“Not just so disagreeable as yesterday,” she
added, a trifle more cordially.</p>

<p>“Ay&mdash;na.” He glanced up and down the
counter. “I&mdash;I was wantin’ a pencil,” he said at
last.</p>

<p>“A <em>pencil</em>!” cried Christina; then in a voice
from which all the amazement had gone: “A
pencil&mdash;oh, certainly.”</p>

<p>Macgregor reddened, opened his mouth and&mdash;shut
it. Why should he make a bigger fool of
himself by explaining that he had meant to say “a
pen?” Besides (happy thought!) the pen would
be an excuse for calling another time.</p>

<p>Christina opened the drawer and paused, pursing
her lips. Her tone was casual as she said: “I
hope you found the dozen you bought lately quite
satisfactory.”</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;ay, they were&mdash;splendid.” Macgregor
blushed again.</p>

<p>Christina smiled as prettily as any musical
comedy actress selling guinea button-holes at a
charity fête. She said: “I’ll tell Miss Tod.
She’ll be delighted. It’s a great saving, buying a
dozen, isn’t it?” Her hand went into the drawer.
“Especially when one uses so many. It’s hardly
worth while buying a single pencil, is it?” Her
hand came out of the drawer and laid a bundle in
front of Macgregor. “Wonderful how they can
do it for threepence!”</p>

<p>He stared at the bundle, his will fluttering like
a bird under a strawberry net. Dash the pencils!&mdash;but
she might be offended <span class="lock">if&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Some shops sell those pencils at a ha’penny
each, I know,” she went on; “and I believe some
have the neck&mdash;I mean the cheek to ask a penny.
Would you like me to put them in paper, sir?”</p>

<p>Recovering from the shock of the “sir,” Macgregor
shook his head, and laid three coppers on
the counter.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said she. “Is there anything
else to-day?”</p>

<p>Before he could answer, the door opened and an
elderly man entered. At the ring of the bell Macgregor
dropped the bundle; the flimsy fastening
parted, and the pencils were scattered.</p>

<p>Christina checked an “Oh, crickey!” and
turned to attend to the second customer while the
first collected his purchases from the floor.</p>

<p>The elderly man wanted a newspaper only, but
thanks to Christina’s politeness over the transaction,
he went out feeling as if he had done quite a
stroke of business.</p>

<p>“I think you should let me tie them up for you,”
she said to Macgregor, who was rising once more,
rather red in the face.</p>

<p>“Thank ye,” he said apologetically, handing her
the pencils.</p>

<p>“Accidents will happen,” she remarked cheerfully.
“If they didn’t, there would be mighty
little happening. I say, there’s only eleven pencils
here.”</p>

<p>“The ither rolled ablow the counter. It doesna
matter,” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, but that won’t do. See, I’ll give you another
now, and get the one under the counter some
day&mdash;next stock-taking, maybe.” She began to
make a parcel, then halted in the operation. “Are
you sure there’s nothing else that I can show you
to-day, sir?”</p>

<p>Macgregor didn’t want to go just yet, so he
appeared to be thinking deeply.</p>

<p>“Essay paper&mdash;notebooks,” she murmured;
“notepaper&mdash;envelopes&mdash;<span class="lock">indiarubber&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Injinrubber,” said Macgregor. (He would
give it to Jimsie.)</p>

<p>She turned and whipped a box from a shelf.
“Do you prefer the red or the white&mdash;species?”
she enquired, and felt glad she hadn’t said “sort.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m no heedin’ which,” he replied generously,
with a bare glance at the specimens laid out
for his inspection.</p>

<p>“All the same price&mdash;one penny per cake. The
red is more flexible.” By way of exhibiting its
quality, she took the oblong lengthwise between
her finger and thumb and squeezed. To her dismay
it sprang from her grip and struck her customer
on the chin.</p>

<p>“Oh, mercy!” she exclaimed. “I didna <span class="lock">mean&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>Recovering the missile from the floor, he said
gravely: “My! ye’re a comic!”</p>

<p>“I’m not! I tell ye I didna mean it. Did it
hurt ye?”</p>

<p>“No’ likely! I ken ye didna try it.” He
smiled faintly. “If ye had tried to hit me, ye wud
ha’e missed me.”</p>

<p>“If I had tried, I wud ha’e hit ye a heap harder,”
she said indignantly.</p>

<p>“Try, then.” His smile broadened as he offered
her the cake. “I’ll stan’ still.”</p>

<p>Christina’s sporting instinct was roused. “I’ll
bet ye the price o’ the cake I hit ye.” And let fly.</p>

<p>It went over his left shoulder.</p>

<p>“Ha’e anither shot,” he said, stooping to pick
up the rubber.</p>

<p>But as swiftly as it had gone her professional
dignity returned. Macgregor came back to the
counter to receive a stiff: “Thank you. Do you
require anything else to-day?”</p>

<p>His mumbled negative, his disappointed countenance
reproached her.</p>

<p>“Of course,” she said pleasantly, as she put his
purchases in paper, “I cannot charge you for the
indiarubber.”</p>

<p>“Aw, cheese it!” he muttered shortly, flinging
a penny on the counter.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon?”&mdash;this with supreme
haughtiness.</p>

<p>“Oh, ye needna. An’ ye can keep yer injinrubber&mdash;an’
yer pencils forbye!” With these
words he wheeled about and strode for the door.</p>

<p>Christina collapsed. A customer who paid for
goods and then practically threw them at her was
beyond her experience and comprehension.</p>

<p>“Here!” she cried. “Stop a minute! I&mdash;I
was jist jokin’. Come back an’ get yer things.
We’ll no’ quarrel aboot the penny.”</p>

<p>With his fingers on the handle he paused and
regarded her half angrily, half reproachfully. He
wanted to say something very cutting, but it
wouldn’t come.</p>

<p>“Please,” said Christina softly, dropping her
eyes. “Ye’ll get me into trouble if ye dinna tak’
them.”</p>

<p>“Eh?”</p>

<p>“Miss Tod wud be vexed wi’ me for lossin’ a
guid customer. She wud gi’e me the sack,
maybe.”</p>

<p>“Wud she?&mdash;the auld besom!” cried Macgregor,
retracing his steps.</p>

<p>“Oh, whisht! She’s no’ an auld besom. But
I ken she wud be vexed.” Christina sighed. “I
suppose I’m to blame <span class="lock">for&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“It’s me that’s to blame,” he interrupted.
“Here!” he said in an unsteady whisper, “will ye
shake han’s?”</p>

<p>After a momentary hesitation she gave him her
hand, saying graciously: “I’ve no objections, I’m
sure. To tell the truth,” she went on, “I am not
entirely disinterested in you, sir.”</p>

<p>Macgregor withdrew his empty hand. “I&mdash;I
wish ye wudna speak like that,” he sighed.</p>

<p>“Like what?”</p>

<p>“That awfu’ genteel talk.”</p>

<p>“Sorry,” she said. “But it gangs doon wi’
maist o’ the customers. Besides, I try to keep it
up to please ma aunt. But it doesna soun’
frien’ly-like, does it?”</p>

<p>“That’s why I dinna like it,” he ventured, more
easily.</p>

<p>“I see. But if ye was servin’ in a shop ye wud
ha’e to speak the same way.”</p>

<p>“I’m in the pentin’ trade,” he informed her,
with an air of importance.</p>

<p>“I’ve a nose&mdash;but I like the smell fine. Ye’re
no’ offended, are ye?”</p>

<p>“I’m no’ that easy offended. Is Miss Tod yer
aunt?”</p>

<p>“Na, na; she’s nae relation. Ma aunt is Mrs.
James Baldwin.” In the frankest fashion she
gave a brief sketch of her position on the world’s
surface. While she spoke she seated herself on
the stool, and Macgregor, without thinking about it,
subsided upon the chair and leant his arm upon the
counter. Ere she ended they were regarding each
other almost familiarly.</p>

<p>Anon Macgregor furnished a small account of
himself and his near relatives.</p>

<p>“That’s queer!” commented Christina when he
had finished.</p>

<p>“What?” he asked, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Ma Uncle James is a great frien’ o’ your
Uncle Purdie. Your uncle buys a heap o’ fancy
things frae mine, an’ he’s often been in oor hoose.
I hear he’s worth a terrible heap o’ money, but naebody
wud think it. I like him fine.”</p>

<p>“Ye wudna like ma aunt fine,” said Macgregor.</p>

<p>“No’ bein’ acquaint wi’ her, I canna say,”
Christina returned. “But I believe if it hadna
been for her yer uncle wud never ha’e made his
fortune at the grocery <span class="lock">trade&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Her! What had she got to dae wi’ ’t?”</p>

<p>“Dear knows; but Uncle James says she egged
him on to mak’ money frae the day she married
him. But mony a woman does that. I wud dae
it masel’&mdash;no’ that I’m greedy; I jist couldna
endure a man that didna get on. I hate a stick-in-the-mud.
It’s a fac’, though, that Mr. Purdie
got the push-on frae his wife. An’ Uncle James
says he’s no’ near done yet: he’ll be Lord Provost
afore he’s feenished. Ye should keep in wi’ yer
Uncle Purdie.”</p>

<p>Macgregor scarcely heard her latter words. His
Aunt Purdie responsible for his Uncle Purdie’s
tremendous success in business! The idea was
almost shocking. From his earliest boyhood it
had been a sort of religion with him to admire his
uncle and despise his aunt. Could any good thing
come out of Aunt Purdie?</p>

<p>“I doobt yer Uncle James doesna ken <em>her</em> extra
weel,” he said at last.</p>

<p>“Oh, ma uncle’s a splendid judge o’ character,”
she assured him. “Especially female character,”
she added. “That’s why he married ma aunt an’
adopted me. I took his name, like ma aunt did
when she married him. It was a love match, in
spite o’ their ages. There’s grander names, but
nane better, nor Baldwin. In ma youth I called it
Bald-yin to tease ma aunt when she was saft on
him. But never heed aboot that the noo. D’ye
ken what astonishes me aboot yersel’?”</p>

<p>“What?” asked Macgregor, startled.</p>

<p>“That ye’re no’ in the grocery trade.”</p>

<p>“Me! What for wud I be a grocer?”</p>

<p>“What for are ye a penter? An’ yer Uncle
Purdie has nae offspring. My! if I had had a
chance like you!” She heaved a sigh. “I’m
sure yer uncle wud ha’e ta’en ye into his business.
Ye canna be sae stupid that he wudna gi’e ye even
a trial. Nae offence intended.”</p>

<p>“I could ha’e been in the business if I had
wanted,” Macgregor replied, with some dignity.
“He offered me a job when I left the schule. But,
ye see, I aye had the notion to be a penter. I like
to be movin’ ma han’s an’ feet.”</p>

<p>“An’ what did yer parents say?”</p>

<p>“They canna thole Aunt Purdie. It was her
that brought the message frae ma uncle&mdash;as if it
was a favour. They said I was to choose for
masel’.”</p>

<p>“Pride’s an awfu’ thing for costin’ folk cash,”
the girl remarked, with a shake of her head.</p>

<p>“Eh?”</p>

<p>“Naething,” she replied. After a slight pause
she continued: “It’s no’ for me to speak aboot
yer parents, but I hope ye’ll excuse me sayin’ that
ye’re a bigger fool than ye look.”</p>

<p>“Wha&mdash;what d’ye mean?”</p>

<p>“I didna mean to insult ye or hurt yer feelin’s.”
Another pause. “D’ye no’ want to get up in the
world, man? D’ye no’ want to be a millionaire&mdash;or
a thoosandaire, onyway?”</p>

<p>“Me?”</p>

<p>“Ay, you!”</p>

<p>Across the counter he regarded her in a semi-dazed
fashion, speechless. She was rather
flushed; her eyes danced with eagerness. Apparently
she was all in earnest.</p>

<p>“Are ye gaun to be a penter a’ yer life?” she
demanded.</p>

<p>“What for no’?” he retorted with some spirit.
“It’s guid pay.”</p>

<p>“Guid pay! In ten year what’ll ye be makin’?”</p>

<p>“I couldna say. Maybe&mdash;maybe twenty-five
shillin’s; <span class="lock">maybe&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“A week?”</p>

<p>“Ay; of course,” he said, nettled. “D’ye think
I meant a month?”</p>

<p>“If ye was wi’ yer uncle an’ stickin’ to yer business,
I wud ha’e said ’a day’! Ma gracious goodness!
if ye was pleasin’ a man like that, there’s nae
sayin’ where ye wud be in ten year.”</p>

<p>“Ach,” he said, with an attempt at lightness,
“I’m no’ heedin’.”</p>

<p>Christina doubled her fist and smote the counter
with such violence that he fairly jumped on his
seat.</p>

<p>“Ye’re no’ heedin’! What’s the use o’ bein’
alive if ye’re no’ heedin’? But ye’re a’ the same,
you young workin’ men. Yer rule is to dae the
least ye can for yer wages, an’ never snap at an
opportunity. An’ when ye get aulder ye gang on
strike an’ gas aboot yer rights, but ye keep dumb
enough aboot yer deserts, <span class="lock">an’&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Here, haud on!” cried Macgregor, now
thoroughly roused. “What dae you ken aboot
it? Ye’re jist a <span class="lock">lassie&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“I’ve eyes an’ ears.”</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>“Are ye a&mdash;a suffragist?” he asked, weakly.</p>

<p>“I ha’ena quite decided on that p’int. Are you
in favour o’ votes for females? Aweel, there’s
nae use answerin’, for ye’ve never thought aboot it.
I suppose, like the ither young men aboot here, ye
buy yer brains every Seturday done up in the
sports edition o’ the evenin’ paper. Oh, Christopher
Columbus! that’s when <em>I</em> get busy on a
Seturday nicht. Footba’&mdash;footba’&mdash;footba’!”</p>

<p>Macgregor swallowed these remarks, and reverted
to the previous question. “What,” he
enquired a little loftily, “dae <em>you</em> expec’ to be
earnin’ ten year frae the noo?”</p>

<p>Promptly, frankly, she replied: “If I’m no’
drawin’ thirty shillin’s a week I’ll consider masel’
a bad egg. Of course, it a’ depends on whether I
select to remain single or itherwise.”</p>

<p>This was too much for Macgregor. He surveyed
her with such blank bewilderment that she
burst out laughing.</p>

<p>He went red to the roots of his hair, or at any
rate to the edge of his hat. “Oh, I kent fine ye
was coddin’ me,” he said crossly, looking hurt and
getting to his feet.</p>

<p>She stopped laughing at once. “That’s the
worst o’ talkin’ plain sense nooadays; folk think
ye’re only coddin’,” she observed, good-humouredly.
“I’m sorry I vexed ye.” Impulsively she held out
her hand. “I doobt we’ll ha’e to shake again.”</p>

<p>This, also, was too much for Macgregor. He
seized her fingers in a grip that made her squeal.</p>

<p>And just then bang went the bell above the door.</p>

<p>Christina bit her lip and smiled through her tears
as M. Tod entered the shop.</p>

<p>“Anything else to-day?” she enquired in her
politest voice, and placed the little parcel under
Macgregor’s hand.</p>

<p>His reply was inaudible. His hand closed automatically
on his purchase, his eyes met hers for
the fraction of a second, and then he practically
bolted.</p>

<p>“Young men are aye in sich a great hurry nooadays,”
remarked M. Tod, beginning to remove her
gloves.</p>

<p>“He’s the young man that bought the dizzen
pencils the ither nicht,” Christina explained, examining
the joints of her right hand. “I’ve just been
sellin’ him anither dizzen.”</p>

<p>“Dearie me! he <em>must</em> be a reporter on yin of the
papers.”</p>

<p>“He’s a whale for pencils, whatever he is,”
Christina returned, putting straight the piles of
periodicals that adorned the counter. “I doobt he
wud need to report wi’ his feet forbye his han’s to
get through a dizzen pencils in three days. It’s a
bit o’ a mystery aboot the pencils.”</p>

<p>“A mystery!” exclaimed M. Tod, who was just
about to blow into a glove.</p>

<p>Christina picked the neglected penny from the
counter and dropped it into the till. “It’s a case
o’ <span class="lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cherchez la femme</span>,” she said softly, with quite
a passable accent.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” murmured M. Tod.</p>

<p>“French,” sighed Christina, making a jotting of
her last sales, and taking a long time to do it.</p>

<p>M. Tod  stared for a moment or two, shook her
head, drew a long breath, and with the same inflated
her glove.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">CHAPTER SEVEN</h3>
<hr />
<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Macgregor</span> was half-way home ere he comprehended
the cause of the dull ache about his temples.
He eased his hat and obtained relief. But there
was no lid to lift from his mind which seemed to
be overcrowded with a jumble of ideas&mdash;old ideas
turned topsy-turvy, some damaged, some twisted,
and new ideas struggling, as it were, for existence.
Moral earthquakes are not infrequent during our
’teens and twenties; by their convulsions they
provide construction material for character; but
the material is mixed, and we are left to choose
whether we shall erect sturdy towers or jerry-buildings.</p>

<p class="center">&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;</p>

<p>The boy was not, of course, aware that here was
a crisis in his life. He was staggered and disturbed,
just as he would have been had the smooth,
broad street on which he walked suddenly become
a narrow pass beset with rifts and boulders. The
upheaval of his preconceived notions of girlhood
had been sharp indeed. He had never heard a
girl speak as Christina had spoken; it had never
occurred to him that a girl could speak so. But
while he felt hurt and vexed, he harboured no
resentment; her frank friendliness had disposed of
that; and while he was humbled, he was not&mdash;thanks
to his modesty, or, if you prefer it, lack of
cocksureness&mdash;grievously humiliated. It is not
in the nature of healthy youth to let misery have all
its own way.</p>

<p>Before he reached home he was able to extract
several sips of comfort from his recent experience.
He knew her name and she knew his; they had
discovered a mutual acquaintance (how we love
those mutual acquaintances&mdash;sometimes!); they
had shaken hands twice.</p>

<p>He spent the evening indoors&mdash;he might have
done otherwise had not Christina said something
about being busy on Saturday nights. He was
patient with his little brother, almost tender towards
his sister. He played several games of draughts
with his father, wondering between his deplorable
moves when he should see Christina again. He
spoke in a subdued fashion. And about nine
o’clock his mother anxiously asked him whether he
was feeling quite well, and offered to prepare a
homely potion. One regrets to record that he
returned a rough answer and went off to bed, leaving
Lizzie to shake her head more in sorrow than
in anger while she informed John that she doubted
Macgregor was “sickenin’ for something.” As
Macgregor had not condescended to play draughts
for at least two years, John was inclined to share
her fears; it did not occur to him to put down such
conduct to feminine influence; and an hour later,
at her suggestion, he went to his son’s room and
softly opened the door.</p>

<p>“Oh! ye’re no’ in yer bed yet, Macgreegor?”</p>

<p>“I’m jist gaun.”</p>

<p>“What are ye workin’ at?”</p>

<p>“Jist sharpenin’ a pencil. I’ll no’ be lang”&mdash;impatiently.</p>

<p>“Are ye feelin’ weel enough?”</p>

<p>“I’m fine. Dinna fash yersel’.”</p>

<p>John withdrew and reported to Lizzie. She was
not satisfied, and before going to bed, about eleven
o’clock, she listened at Macgregor’s door. All she
heard was: “Here, Jimsie, I wish to peace ye wud
keep yer feet to yersel’.”</p>

<p>She opened the door. “Laddie, are ye no’ sleepin’
yet?”</p>

<p>“Hoo can I sleep wi’ Jimsie jabbin’ his feet in
ma back?”</p>

<p>She entered, and going to the bed removed the
unconscious Jimsie to his own portion thereof, at
the same time urging him into a more comfortable
position. Then she came round and laid her hand
on her first-born’s brow.</p>

<p>“Are ye sure ye’re a’ richt, laddie?”</p>

<p>“Ay, I’m fine. I wish ye wudna fash,” he said
shortly, turning over.</p>

<p>Lizzie went out, closing the door gently. On the
kitchen dresser she set out the medicine bottle and
spoon against emergencies.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is a mansion in Heaven that will
always be empty&mdash;a mansion waiting to receive
those who in their youth never snubbed their
anxious parents. Ere the door closed Macgregor
was pricked with compunction. He was sensitive
enough for that. But it is the sensitive people who
hurt the people they care for.</p>

<p>In extenuation let it be said at once that the boy
was enduring a dire reaction. It now appeared
that Christina’s friendliness had been all in the way
of business. Socially (he did not think the word,
of course) Christina was beyond him. Christina,
for all he knew, sat at night in a parlour, had an
aunt that kept a servant (and, maybe, a gramaphone),
was accustomed to young men in high
collars and trousers that always looked new. Yes,
she had shaken hands with him simply in order to
get him to come back and buy another dozen of
pencils.</p>

<p>He was very unhappy. He tossed from side to
side until the voice of Jimsie, drowsy and peevish,
declared that he had taken all the clothes. Which
was practically true, though he did not admit it as
he disentangled himself of the blankets and flung
them all at his brother. He did not care if he
froze&mdash;until he began to feel a little cold, when he
rescued with difficulty a portion of the coverings
from Jimsie’s greedy clutch. He would not go to
the shop again. But he would pass it as often as
possible. He would get Willie Thomson to accompany
him, and they would smoke cigarettes, and
they would stop at the door when a customer was
entering, and laugh very loudly. He would save
up and take Jessie Mary to the dance&mdash;at least, he
would think about it. After all, it might be more
effective to go to the shop and buy more presents
for Jessie Mary and&mdash;oh, great idea!&mdash;request
with great unconcern that they should be sent to
her address!</p>

<p>The clock in the kitchen struck one. With any
sympathy at all it would have struck at least five.
It was like telling a person in the throes of toothache
that the disease is not serious. By the way,
one wonders if doctors will ever know as much
about disease as patients know about pain. Speculation
apart, it is a sorry business to flatter ourselves
we have been suffering all night only to find
that the night is but beginning. Still, there must
have, been something far wrong with the Robinsons’
kitchen clock. Macgregor waited, but to his
knowledge it never struck two. Indeed, it missed
all the hours until nine.</p>

<p>Macgregor, however, presented himself in good
time for the Sunday breakfast. His punctuality
was too much for his mother, and she insisted on
his taking a dose from the bottle on the dresser.
Even youth is sometimes too tired to argue.
“Onything for peace,” was his ungracious remark
as he raised the spoon to his lips.</p>

<p class="center">&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;</p>

<p>Scotland in its harshest, bleakest period of
religious observance could not have provided a
more dismal Sabbath than Macgregor provided for
himself. Although his mother gave him the option
of staying at home, he accompanied his parents to
church; although he came back with a good appetite,
he refused to let himself enjoy his dinner;
although he desired to take the accustomed Sunday
afternoon walk with his father down to the docks
(they had gone there, weather permitting, for
years), he shut himself up in the solitude of his
bedroom.</p>

<p>He spent most of the afternoon in putting points
to his stock of pencils. How the operation should
have occupied so much time may be explained by
the fact that the lead almost invariably parted from
the wood ere a perfect point was attained. Indeed,
when the task was ended, he had comparatively
little to show for his threepence save a heap of
shavings, fragments and dust. His resentment,
however, was all against M. Tod; he wished she
had been of his own sex and size. He also wished
she had kept an ice-cream shop, open on Sundays.&mdash;No,
he didn’t! Christina wouldn’t like working
on Sundays; besides, an awful lot of chaps
hung about ice-cream shops. He wondered what
church Christina attended. If he only knew, he
might go there in the evening. (What our
churches owe to young womanhood will never be
known.) But there were scores of churches in
Glasgow. It would take years to get round them&mdash;and
in the end she might sit in the gallery and
he under it. In the unlikely event of his again
entering Miss Tod’s shop, there would be no harm
in asking Christina about her church and whether
she sang in the choir. But stop! if she didn’t sing
in the choir, she might think he was chaffing her.
That wouldn’t do at all. Better just find out about
the church, and if he didn’t get a view of her on
his first visit he could try again.</p>

<p>There appears no reason why Macgregor’s spirits
should have gradually risen throughout these and
other equally rambling reflections; but the fact
remains that they did so. By tea-time he was in a
comely condition of mind. He made young Jimsie
happy with the cake of rubber and presented Jeannie
surreptitiously with a penny, “to buy sweeties.”
He seemed interested in his father’s account of a
vessel that had been in collision the previous day.
He did not scowl when his mother expressed satisfaction
with the way in which he was punishing the
bread and butter, and openly congratulated herself
on having administered the physic just in time.
Nay, more; he offered to stay in the house with
Jimsie while John and Lizzie took an evening stroll
and Jeannie went with a friend to evening service.
No people are quite so easily made happy as parents,
and when, out-of-doors, John suggested that Macgregor’s
weekly allowance should be raised to one
shilling, Lizzie actually met him half-way by
promising to make it ninepence in future.</p>

<p>During their absence Macgregor did his utmost
to amuse Jimsie, who was suffering from an
incipient cold, but shortly after their return he
became restless, and ere long announced (rather
indistinctly) his intention of going out for “twa-three”
minutes.</p>

<p>Lizzie was about to ask “where?” when John
remarked that it was a fine night and that he would
come too. Thus was frustrated Macgregor’s
desire to take one look at the shuttered shrine with
“M. Tod” over the portal&mdash;a very foolish sort of
desire, as many of us know&mdash;from experience.</p>

<p>In the circumstances Macgregor accepted his
father’s company with a fairly good grace, merely
submitting that the walk should be a short one.</p>

<p>On the way home, at a corner, under a lamp,
they came upon Willie Thomson in earnest and
apparently amicable conversation with Jessie Mary.
Such friendliness struck Macgregor as peculiar, for
since the days of their childhood the twain had
openly expressed contempt and dislike for each
other, and he wondered what was “up,” especially
when the sight of him appeared to cause Willie, at
least, considerable embarrassment. But presently
the happy idea flashed upon him that Willie had
suddenly become “sweet” on Jessie Mary, and
would accordingly need to be dodged no longer.
He felt more friendly towards Willie than for some
time past. His feelings with regard to Jessie
Mary were less definite, but he was sure his face
had not got “extra red” under her somewhat
mocking glance.</p>

<p>“Ye’re no’ as thick wi’ Wullie as ye used to be,”
his father remarked.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ve nae quarrel,” he returned. “What
did ye say was the name o’ that damaged boat ye
saw the day?”</p>

<p class="center">&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;</p>

<p>He went to bed not unhappy. He would find a
way of knowing Christina better and proving to her
that the painting trade was as good as any.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">CHAPTER EIGHT</h3>
<hr />
<p class="p2"><span class="sc">“Ye’ve</span> been in business a long time, Miss Tod,”
said Christina on Monday afternoon, looking up
from the front advertising page of a newspaper;
“so I wish ye wud tell me yer honest opinion o’
business in general.”</p>

<p>M. Tod  paused in the act of polishing a fancy
ink-pot (she had spasms of industry for which
there was no need) and stared in bewildered
fashion at her assistant. “Dearie me, lassie!” she
exclaimed, “ye say the queerest things! Ma
honest opinion o’ business? I’m sure I never
thought <span class="lock">aboot&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“I’ll put it anither way. Supposin’ ye was back
at the schule, an’ ye was asked to define business&mdash;ye
ken what define means&mdash;what wud be yer
answer?”</p>

<p>“Is it fun ye’re after?” M. Tod enquired, a
trifle suspiciously.</p>

<p>“I was never mair serious in ma life,” Christina
returned rather indignantly.</p>

<p>“I didna mean to offend ye,” the other said
gently. “But ye ken fine what business is&mdash;whiles
I think ye ken better nor me, though I’ve
been at it for near six-an’-thirty years.”</p>

<p>“I’m not offended,” said Christina, dropping
the vernacular for the moment. “And I merely
desired to know if your definition of business was
the same as mine.”</p>

<p>It always made M. Tod a little nervous when her
assistant addressed her in such correct speech.
“Business,” she began, and halted. She set the
ink-pot on the counter, and tried to put the duster
in her pocket.</p>

<p>“A few words will suffice,” the girl remarked
encouragingly, and took charge of the duster.</p>

<p>“Business,” resumed the old woman, and quite
unconsciously put her hands behind her back,
“business is jist buyin’ and sellin’.” And she gave
a little smile of relief and satisfaction.</p>

<p>Christina shook her head. “I suppose that’s
what they taught ye at the schule&mdash;jist the same
as they taught me. If it wasna for their fancy
departments, sich as physiology an’ Sweedish
drill, the schules wud be oot o’ date. ‘Jist buyin’
an’ sellin’!’&mdash;Oh, Christopher Columbus!”</p>

<p>M. Tod  was annoyed, partly, no doubt, at discovering
her hands behind her back, but ere she
could express herself Christina added:</p>

<p>“In <em>ma</em> honest opinion business chiefly consists
in folk coddin’ yin anither.”</p>

<p>M. Tod  gasped. “Coddin’! D’ye mean deceivin’?”</p>

<p>“Na; there’s a difference between coddin’ an’
deceivin’. Same sort o’ difference as between war
an’ murder. An’ they say that all’s fair in love&mdash;I
ha’e ma doobts aboot love&mdash;an’ war. Mind ye,
I’m no’ sayin’ onything against coddin’. We’re a’
in the same boat. Some cods wi’ advertisin’&mdash;see
daily papers; some cods wi’ talk; some cods wi’
lookin’ solemn an’ smilin’ jist at the right times.
But we’re a’ coddin’, cod, cod, coddin’! But we’ll
no’ admit it! An’ naebody wud thank us if we
did.”</p>

<p>The old woman was almost angry. “I’m sure
I never codded a customer in ma life,” she cried.</p>

<p>Christina regarded her very kindly for a second
or two ere she returned pleasantly: “I wudna say
but what you’re an exception to the rule, Miss Tod.
But ye’re a rare exception. Even ma uncle&mdash;an’
he’s the honestest man in the world&mdash;once codded
me when I was assistin’ ma aunt at Kilmabeg, afore
she got married. Wi’ his talk an’ his smiles he got
me to buy things against ma better judgment&mdash;things
I was sure wud never sell. If he had been
dumb an’ I had been blind, I would never ha’e
made the purchase. But I was young then. Of
course <em>he</em> didna want to cod me; it was jist a habit
he had got into wi’ bein’ in business. But there’s
nae doobt,” she went on calmly, ignoring M. Tod’s
obvious desire to get a word in, “there’s nae doobt
that coddin’ is yin o’ the secrets o’ success. When
ye consider that half the trade o’ the world consists
in sellin’ things that folk dinna need an’ whiles
dinna <span class="lock">want&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Whisht, lassie! Ye speak as if naebody had
a conscience!”</p>

<p>“I didna mean that,” was the mild reply. “It’s
the only thing in this world that’s no’ easy codded&mdash;though
some folk seem to be able to do the
trick. For, of course, there’s a limit to coddin’ in
business&mdash;fair coddin’, I mean. But ye’ve taken
ma remarks ower seriously, Miss Tod.”</p>

<p>“I never heard sich remarks in a’ ma days.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry I’ve annoyed ye.”</p>

<p>“Ye ha’ena annoyed me, dearie. But I’m
vexed to think ye’ve got sich notions in yer young
heid.” M. Tod sighed.</p>

<p>Christina sighed also, a little impatiently, and
picked up the fancy ink-pot from the counter.
“Hoo lang ha’e ye had this in the shop?” she
enquired carelessly.</p>

<p>M. Tod  shook her head. “Ten years, onyway.
It wudna sell.”</p>

<p>“It’s marked eighteenpence.”</p>

<p>“Ay. But when I had a wee sale, five year
back, I put it among a lot of nick-nacks at threepence,
an’ even then it wudna sell. It’s no’ pretty.”</p>

<p>“It’s ugly&mdash;but that’s nae reason for it no’
sellin’.” Christina examined the glass carefully.
“It’s no’ in bad condition,” she observed. “Wud
ye part wi’ it for ninepence?”</p>

<p>“Ninepence! I’ll never get ninepence!”</p>

<p>“Never say die till ye’re buried! Jist wait a
minute.” Christina went over to the desk and
spent about five minutes there, while M. Tod
watched her with intermittent wags of her old
head.</p>

<p>The girl came back with a small oblong of white
card. “Dinna touch it, Miss Tod. The ink’s no’
dry,” she said warningly, and proceeded to place
the inkpot and card together in a prominent position
on the glass show-case that covered a part of
the counter. “Noo, that’ll gi’e it a chance. Instead
o’ keepin’ it in a corner as if we were
ashamed o’ it, we’ll mak’ a feature o’ it for a week,
an’ see what happens. Ye’ll get yer ninepence
yet.”</p>

<p>Christina printed admirably, and her employer
had no difficulty in reading the card a yard away
even without her glasses. It bore these words:</p>

<p class="center">ANTIQUE</p>

<p class="center">NOVEL GIFT</p>

<p class="center smaller">MERELY 9D.</p>

<p>“If ye call a thing ‘antique,’” explained Christina,
“folk forget its ugliness. An’ the public
likes a thing wi’ ‘novel’ on it, though they wudna
believe ye if ye said it was new. An’ as for ‘gift’&mdash;weel,
that adds to the inkpot’s chances o’ findin’
a customer. D’ye see?”</p>

<p>“Ay,” said the old woman. “Ye’re a clever
lassie, but I doobt ye’ll never get ninepence.”</p>

<p>“Gi’e me a week,” said Christina, “an’ if it
doesna disappear in that time, we’ll keep it till
Christmas an’ reduce it to a shillin’. But I think
a week’ll suffice.”</p>

<p>M. Tod  hesitated ere she gently said: “But
ye’ll no try to cod onybody, dearie?”</p>

<p>Christina waved her hand in the direction of
the card. “I’ll leave the public to cod itsel’,” she
said. “Noo it’s time ye was gettin’ ready for yer
walk.”</p>

<p class="center">&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;</p>

<p>It may have been that Christina, in the back of
her mind, saw in Macgregor a possible customer
for the ugly inkpot. At any rate, she was disappointed
when the evening passed without his entering
the shop; she hoped she had not spoken too
plainly to him on his last visit&mdash;not but what he
needed plain speaking. She was not to know until
later how Macgregor’s employer had unexpectedly
decreed that he should work overtime that night,
nor how Macgregor had obeyed joylessly despite
the extra pay.</p>

<p>He called the following evening&mdash;and found
M. Tod alone at the receipt of custom. He had
yet to learn that on Tuesdays and Thursdays
Christina left business early in order to attend
classes. He must have looked foolish as he approached
the counter, yet he had the presence of
mind to ask for a ha’penny evening paper.
Fortune being fickle&mdash;thank goodness!&mdash;does not
confine her favour to the brave, and on this occasion
she had arranged that M. Tod should be sold out
of that particular evening paper. So Macgregor
saved his money as well as his self-respect.</p>

<p>On the morrow M. Tod, who still clung to the
belief that the young man wrote for the papers,
reported the incident to her assistant. Possibly
Christina could have given a better reason than
this for her subsequent uncertainty of temper, and
doubtless it was mere absent-mindedness that
accounted for her leaving the sliding panel to the
window a few inches open after she had thrown
it wide without any apparent purpose. And it is
highly probable that Macgregor would have taken
advantage of the aperture had he not been again
working overtime on that and on the two following
nights.</p>

<p>So it was not until Saturday afternoon that they
met once more. Macgregor held aloof from the
shop until M. Tod appeared&mdash;of course she was
later than usual!&mdash;and, after an anxious gaze at
the sky, proceeded to toddle up the street. Then
he approached the window. He was feeling fairly
hopeful. His increased allowance had come as a
pleasant surprise. Moreover, he had saved during
the week fourpence in car-money and had spent
nothing. He had fifteenpence in his pocket&mdash;wealth!</p>

<p>As he halted at the window, the panel at the
back was drawn tight with an audible snap. For
a moment he felt snubbed; then he assured himself
there was nothing extraordinary in the occurrence,
and prepared to enter the shop, reminding himself,
firstly, that he was going to purchase a penholder,
secondly, that he was not going to lose his head
when the bell banged.</p>

<p>Christina was perched at the desk writing with
much diligence. She laid down a pencil and
slipped from her stool promptly but without haste.</p>

<p>“Good-afternoon, Mr. Robinson,” she said
demurely.</p>

<p>If anyone else in the world had called him
“Mister Robinson” he would have resented it as
chaff, but now, though taken aback, he felt no
annoyance.</p>

<p>“Ay, it’s a fine day,” he returned, rather irrelevantly,
and suddenly held out his hand.</p>

<p>This was a little more than Christina had expected,
but she gave him hers with the least possible
hesitation. For once in her life, however, she was
not ready with a remark.</p>

<p>Macgregor having got her hand, let it go immediately,
as though he were doubtful as to the
propriety of what he had done.</p>

<p>“I’ve been workin’ late every day this week
excep’ Tuesday,” he said.</p>

<p>For an instant Christina looked pleased; then she
calmly murmured: “Oh, indeed.”</p>

<p>“Ay, every day excep’ Tuesday, till nine
o’clock,” he informed her, with an effort.</p>

<p>“Really!”</p>

<p>He struggled against a curious feeling of mental
suffocation, and said: “I was in here on Tuesday
nicht. I&mdash;I didna see ye.”</p>

<p>“I attend a shorthand class on Tuesday nights.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” He wanted very much to make her
smile, so he said: “When I didna see ye on Tuesday,
I was afraid ye had got the sack.”</p>

<p>Christina drew herself up. “What can I do for
you to-day, Mr. Robinson?” she enquired with
stiff politeness.</p>

<p>“I was jist jokin’,” he cried, dismayed; “I didna
mean to offend ye.”</p>

<p>Christina’s fingers played a soundless tune on the
edge of the counter; her eyes gazed over his head
into space. She waited with an air of weary
patience.</p>

<p>“I was wantin’ a pen&mdash;a penholder,” he said at
last, in a hopeless tone of voice.</p>

<p>“Ha’penny or penny?” she asked without
moving.</p>

<p>“A penny yin, please,” he said humbly.</p>

<p>She turned and twitched a card from its nail,
and laid it before him. “Kindly take your
choice,” she said, and moved up the counter a yard
or so. She picked up a novelette and opened it.</p>

<p>Macgregor examined and fingered the penholders
for nearly a minute by the clock ere he glanced at
her. She appeared to be engrossed in the novelette,
but he was sure he had hurt her feelings.</p>

<p>“I was jist jokin’,” he muttered.</p>

<p>“Oh, you wanted a ha’penny one.” She
twitched down another card of penholders, laid it
before him as if&mdash;so it seemed to him&mdash;he had
been dirt, and went back to her novelette.</p>

<p>Had he been less in love he would surely have
been angry then. Had she seen his look she would
certainly have been sorry.</p>

<p>There was a long silence while his gaze wandered,
while he wondered what he could do to make
amends.</p>

<p>And lo! the ugly inkpot caught his eye. He
read the accompanying card several times; he
fingered the money in his pocket; he told himself
insistently that ninepence was not worth considering.
Once more he glanced at the girl. She was
frowning slightly over the page. Perhaps she
wanted him to go.</p>

<p>“I’ll buy that, if ye like,” he said, pointing at
the inkpot.</p>

<p>“Eh?” cried Christina, and dropped the
novelette. “Beg your pardon,” she went on,
recovering her dignity and moving leisurely
towards him, “but I did not quite catch what you
observed.” She was pleased that she had used the
word “observed.”</p>

<p>“I’ll buy that,” repeated Macgregor. “What’s
it for?”</p>

<p>“It’s for keeping ink in. It’s an inkpot. The
price is ninepence.”</p>

<p>“I can read,” said Macgregor, with perhaps his
first essay in irony.</p>

<p>Christina tilted her chin. “I presume you want
it for a gift,” she said haughtily.</p>

<p>“Na; I’m gaun to pay for it.”</p>

<p>“I meant to give away as a gift.” It was rather
a stupid sentence, she felt. If she had only remembered
to use the word “bestow.”</p>

<p>The boy’s clear eyes met hers for a second.</p>

<p>“It holds a great deal of ink,” she said, possibly
in reply to her conscience.</p>

<p>“I’ll buy a bottle o’ ink, too, if ye like,” he said
recklessly, and looked at her again.</p>

<p>A flood of honest kindliness swamped the business
instinct of Christina. “I didna mean that!”
she exclaimed, flopping into homely speech; “an’
I wudna sell ye that rotten inkpot for a hundred
pound!”</p>

<p>It will be admitted that Macgregor’s amazement
was natural in the circumstances. Ere he
recovered from it she was in fair control of
herself.</p>

<p>“It’s as good as sold to the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr. McTavish,”
she explained. Her sole foundation for the statement
lay in the fact that the Rev. Mr. McTavish
was to call for a small parcel of stationery about
six o’clock. At the same time she remembered
her duty to her employer. “But we have other
inkpots in profusion,” she declared.</p>

<p>The limit of his endurance was reached. “Oh,”
he stammered, “I wish ye wudna speak to me like
that.”</p>

<p>“Like what?”</p>

<p>“That fancy way&mdash;that genteel English.”</p>

<p>The words might have angered her, but not the
voice. She drew a quick breath and said:</p>

<p>“Are ye a frien’ or a customer?”</p>

<p>“Ye&mdash;ye ken fine what I want to be,” he
answered, sadly.</p>

<p>Now she was sure that she liked him.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, slowly, “suppose ye buy a
ha’penny penholder&mdash;jist for the sake o’ appearances&mdash;an’
then”&mdash;quickly&mdash;“we’ll drop business.”
And she refused to sell him a penny one,
and, indeed, anything else in the shop that
afternoon.</p>

<p>It must be recorded, however, that an hour or
so later she induced the Rev. Mr. McTavish to
buy the ugly inkpot.</p>

<p>“It wasna easy,” she confessed afterwards to
M. Tod, “an’ I doobt he jist bought it to please
me; but it’s awa’ at last, an’ ye’ll never see it
again&mdash;unless, maybe, at a jumble sale. He was
real nice aboot it, an’ gaed awa’ smilin’.”</p>

<p>“I hope ye didna deceive the man,” said M.
Tod, trying not to look gratified.</p>

<p>“I told him the solemn truth. I told him it was
on ma conscience to sell the inkpot afore anither
day had dawned. It’s no’ every day it pays ye to
tell the truth, is it?” The last sentence was
happily inaudible to the old woman.</p>

<p>“But, lassie, I never intended ye to feel ye had
ta’en a vow to sell the inkpot. I wud be unco
vexed to <span class="lock">think&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>Christina gave her employer’s shoulder a little
kindly, reassuring pat. “Na, na; ye needna fash
yersel’ aboot that,” she said. Then, moving
away: “As a matter o’ fac’, I had compromised
myself regardin’ the inkpot in&mdash;in anither
direction.”</p>

<p>Which was all Greek to M. Tod.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">CHAPTER NINE</h3>
<hr />
<p class="p2"><span class="sc">For</span> a fortnight it ran smoothly enough. There
were, to be sure, occasional ripples; little doubts,
little fears, little jealousies; but they passed as
swiftly as they appeared.</p>

<p>Macgregor, having no overtime those weeks,
contrived to visit the shop nightly, excepting Tuesdays
and Thursdays, Christina’s class nights. He
paid his footing, so to speak, with the purchase of
a ha’penny evening paper&mdash;which he could not
well take home since his father was in the habit of
making a similar purchase on the way from work.
M. Tod was rarely in evidence; the evenings found
her tired, and unless several customers demanded
attention at once (a rare event) she remained in
the living-room, browsing on novelettes selected
for her by her assistant. She was given to protesting
she had never done such a thing prior to
Christina’s advent, to which Christina was wont to
reply that, while she herself was long since “fed
up” with such literature, it was high time M. Tod
should know something about it. Only once did
the old woman intrude on the young people and
prevent intimate converse; but even then Macgregor
did not depart unhappy, for Christina’s
farewell smile was reassuring in its whimsicality,
and in young love of all things seeing is believing.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed, all the same, that she
gave him much direct encouragement; her lapses
from absolute discretion were brief as they were
rare. But the affections of the youthful male have
a wonderful way of subsisting on crumbs which
hope magnifies into loaves. Nevertheless, her
kindliness was a definite thing, and under its influence
the boy lost some of his shyness and gained
a little confidence in himself. He had already taken
a leap over one barrier of formality: he had called
her “Christina” to her face, and neither her face
nor her lips had reproved him; he had asked her
to call him “Macgreegor”&mdash;or “Mac” if she
preferred it, and she had promised to “see about
it.”</p>

<p>On this November Saturday afternoon he was on
his way to make the tremendous request that she
should allow him to walk home with her when her
day’s work was over. He was far from sure of
himself. In the reign of Jessie Mary&mdash;what an
old story now!&mdash;he would not have openly craved
permission, but would have hung about on the
chance of meeting her alone and in pleasant
humour. But he could not act so with Christina.
Instinct as well as inclination prevented him.
Moreover, he had been witness, on a certain evening
when he had lingered near the shop&mdash;just to
see her with her hat on&mdash;-of the fate that befell a
young man (a regular customer, too, Christina
told him afterwards) who dared to proffer his
escort off-hand. Christina had simply halted,
turned and pointed, as one might point for a dog’s
guidance, and after a long moment the young man
had gone in the direction opposite to that in which
he had intended. To Macgregor the little scene
had been gratifying yet disturbing. The memory
of it chilled his courage now. But he was not the
boy to relinquish a desire simply because he was
afraid.</p>

<p>He broke his journey at a sweet-shop, and
rather surprised himself by spending sixpence,
although he had been planning to do so for the
past week. He had not yet given Christina anything;
he wanted badly to give her something; and
having bought it, he wondered whether she would
take it. He could not hope that the gift would
affect the answer to his tremendous request.</p>

<p>Coming out of the sweet-shop he caught sight of
the back of Willie Thomson, whom he had not
seen for two weeks. Involuntarily he gave the
boyish whistle, not so long ago the summons that
would have called the one to the other with express
speed. Now it had the reverse effect, for Willie
started, half turned, and then walked quickly up a
convenient side-street. The flight was obvious,
and for a moment Macgregor was hurt and angry.
Then with sudden sympathy he grinned, thinking,
“He’ll be after Jessie Mary, an’ doesna want me.”
He was becoming quite grateful to Willie, for
although he had encountered Jessie Mary several
times of late, she had not reminded him of the
approaching dance, and he gave Willie credit for
that.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Macgregor stood at the
counter that had become a veritable altar. Not
many of us manage to greet the girls of our
dreams precisely as we would or exactly as we have
rehearsed the operation, and Macgregor’s nerves
at the last moment played him a trick.</p>

<p>In a cocky fashion, neither natural nor becoming,
he wagged his head in the direction of the
living-room and flippantly enquired: “Is she
oot?”</p>

<p>To which Christina, her smile of welcome
passing with never a flicker, stiffly replied: “Miss
Tod is out, but may return at any moment.”</p>

<p>“Aw!” he murmured, “I thought she wud
maybe be takin’ her usual walk.”</p>

<p>“What usual walk?”</p>

<p>His hurt look said: “What have I done to
deserve this, Christina?”</p>

<p>And she felt as though she had struck him.
“Ye shouldna tak’ things for granted,” she said,
less sharply. “I didna think ye was yin o’ the
cheeky sort.”</p>

<p>“Me!” he cried in consternation.</p>

<p>“Weel, maybe ye didna mean it, but ye cam’
into the shop like a dog wi’ twa tails. But”&mdash;as
with a sudden inspiration&mdash;“maybe ye’ve been
gettin’ a rise in yer wages. If that’s the case, I’ll
apologise.”</p>

<p>He shook his head. “I dinna ken what ye’re
drivin’ at. I&mdash;I was jist gled to see <span class="lock">ye&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll no’ say ony mair aboot it. Maybe I
was ower smart,” she said hastily. “Kindly
forget ma observations.” She smiled apologetically.</p>

<p>“Are ye no’ gaun to shake han’s wi’ me?” he
asked, still uneasy.</p>

<p>“Surely!” she answered warmly. “An’ I’ve
got a bit o’ news for ye, Mac.” The name slipped
out; she reddened.</p>

<p>Yet her cheek was pale compared with the boy’s.
“Oh!” he exclaimed under his breath. Then
with a brave attempt at carelessness he brought
from his pocket a small white package and laid it
on the counter before her. “It&mdash;it’s for you,”
he said, forgetting his little speech about wanting
to give her something and hoping she would not be
offended.</p>

<p>Christina was not prepared for such a happening;
still, her wits did not desert her. She liked
sweets, but on no account was she going to have
her acceptance of the gift misconstrued. She
glanced at Macgregor, whose eyes did not meet
hers; she glanced at the package; she glanced once
more at Macgregor, and gently uttered the solitary
word:</p>

<p>“Platonic?”</p>

<p>“Na,” he replied. “Jujubes.”</p>

<p>Christina bit her lip.</p>

<p>“D’ye no’ like them?” he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>The matter had got beyond her. She put out
her hand and took the gift, saying: “Thank ye,
Mac; they’re ma favourite sweeties. But&mdash;ye’re
no’ to dae it again.”</p>

<p>“What kin’ o’ sweeties did ye think they was?”
he asked, breaking a short silence.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s o’ nae consequence,” she lightly replied.
“D’ye no’ want to hear ma bit o’ news?”</p>

<p>“’Deed, ay, Christina.” Now more at ease, he
settled himself on the chair by the counter.</p>

<p>“Weel,&mdash;ye’ll excuse me no’ samplin’ the
jujubes the noo; it micht be awkward if a customer
was comin’&mdash;weel, yer Uncle Purdie was visitin’
ma uncle last night, an’ what d’ye think I
did?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I asked him for a job!”</p>

<p>“A job!” exclaimed Macgregor. “In&mdash;in yin
o’ his shops?”</p>

<p>“Na; in his chief office.”</p>

<p>“My! ye’ve a neck&mdash;I mean, ye’re no’ afraid.”</p>

<p>“Ye dinna get muckle in this world wi’oot askin’
for it.”</p>

<p>“What did he say?” the boy enquired, after a
pause.</p>

<p>“He said the job was mine as sune as I was
ready to tak’ it. Ye see, I tell’t him I didna want
to start till I had ma shorthand an’ typewritin’
perfec’. That’ll tak’ me a few months yet.”</p>

<p>“I didna ken ye could typewrite.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve been workin’ at it for near a year,
but I can only get practisin’ afore breakfast an’
whiles in the evenin’. Still, I think I’ll be ready
for the office aboot the spring, if no’ earlier.”</p>

<p>Macgregor regarded her with sorrow mingled
with admiration. “But what way dae ye want to
leave here?” he cried, all at once realising what
the change would mean to him.</p>

<p>“There’s nae prospects in a wee place like this.
Once I’m in a big place, like yer uncle’s, I’ll get
chances. I want to be yer uncle’s private
<span class="lock">secretary&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Ye’re ower young.”</p>

<p>“I didna say in six months.” Her voice
changed. “Are ye no’ pleased, Mac?”</p>

<p>“Hoo can I be pleased when ye’re leavin’ here?
Can ye no’ stop? Ye’re fine where ye are. An’
what’ll Miss Tod dae wantin’ ye?”</p>

<p>“I’ll get uncle to find her another girl&mdash;a
pretty girl, so that ye’ll come here for yer
stationery, eh?”</p>

<p>“If ye leave, I’ll never come here again.
Could ye no’ get a job behind the counter in yin of
ma uncle’s shops?”&mdash;clutching at a straw.</p>

<p>“I’ll gang furder in the office. If I was a man
I daresay I wud try the shop. If I was you, Mac,
I wud try it.”</p>

<p>“I couldna sell folk things.”</p>

<p>“In a big business like yer uncle’s there’s
plenty work besides sellin’. But I suppose ye’ll
stick to the pentin’.”</p>

<p>“Ay,” he said shortly.</p>

<p>“Weel, I suppose it’s nane o’ ma business,” she
said good-humouredly. “But, bein’ a frien’, I
thought ye wud ha’e been pleased to hear ma
news.”</p>

<p>Ere he could reply a woman came in to purchase
note-paper. Possibly Christina’s service was a
trifle less “finished” than usual; and she made no
attempt to sell anything that was not wanted.
Macgregor had a few minutes for reflection, and
when the customer had gone he said, a shade
more hopefully:</p>

<p>“Ye’ll no’ be kep’ as late at the office as here.
Ye’ll ha’e yer evenin’s free, Christina.”</p>

<p>“I’ll ha’e mair time for classes. I’m keen on
learnin’ French an’ German. I ken a bit o’ French
already; a frien’ o’ ma uncle’s, a Frenchman, has
been gi’ein’ me lessons in conversation every Sunday
night for a while back. It’ll be useful if I
become a secretary.”</p>

<p>“Strikes me,” said Macgregor, gloomily, “ye’ve
never ony time for fun.”</p>

<p>“Fun?”</p>

<p>“For walkin’ aboot an’&mdash;an’ that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ye mean oot there.” She swung her hand
in the direction of the street. “I walk here in the
mornin’&mdash;near a mile&mdash;an’ hame at night; an’
I’ve two hours free in the middle o’ the day&mdash;uncle
bargained for that when he let me come to
Miss Tod. As for loafin’ aboot on the street, I
had plenty o’ the street when I was young, afore
ma aunt took me to bide wi’ her at Kilmabeg.
The street was aboot the only place I had then, an’
I suppose I wud be there yet if ma aunt hadna
saved me. D’ye ken, Mac,” she went on almost
passionately, “it’s no’ five years since I wanted a
decent pair o’ shoes an’ a guid square meal....
Oh, I could tell ye things&mdash;but anither time,
maybe. As for spendin’ a’ yer spare time on the
street, when ye’ve ony other place to spend it, it’s&mdash;weel,
I suppose it’s a matter o’ taste; but if I
can dae onything wi’ ma spare time that’ll mak’
me independent later on, I’m gaun to dae it.
That’s flat!” Suddenly she laughed. “Are ye
afraid o’ me, Mac?”</p>

<p>“No’ likely!” he replied, with rather feeble
indignation. “But whiles ye’re awfu’&mdash;queer.”</p>

<p>At that she laughed again. “But I’m no’ so
badly off for fun, as ye call it, either,” she resumed
presently. “Noo an’ then uncle tak’s auntie an’
me to the theatre. Every holiday we gang to the
coast. An’ there’s always folk comin’ to the
<span class="lock">hoose&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Auld folk?”</p>

<p>“Frae your age upwards. An’ next year, when
I put up ma hair, I’ll be gettin’ to dances. Can ye
waltz?”</p>

<p>Macgregor gave his head a dismal shake. “I&mdash;I
doobt ye’re ower high-class,” he muttered
hopelessly. “Ye’ll no’ be for lookin’ at me next
year.”</p>

<p>“No’ if ye wear a face like a fiddle. I like to
look at cheery things. What’s up wi’ ye?”</p>

<p>“Oh, naething. I suppose ye expec’ to be
terrible rich some day.”</p>

<p>“That’s the idea.”</p>

<p>“What’ll ye dae wi’ the money? I suppose ye
dinna ken.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I ken fine,” she returned, with an eager
smile. “I’ll buy auntie a lovely cottage at the
coast, an’ uncle a splendid motor car, an’ masel’ a
big white steam yacht.”</p>

<p>“Ye’re no’ greedy,” he remarked a little sulkily.</p>

<p>“That’ll be merely for a start, of course. I’ll
tak’ ye a trip roun’ the world for the price o’ a
coat o’ pent to the yacht. Are ye on? Maybe
ye’ll be a master-penter by then.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I’ll never be onything&mdash;an’ I’m no’
carin’,” he groaned.</p>

<p>“If ye lie doon in the road ye’ll no’ win far, an’
ye’re likely to get tramped on, forbye. What’s
wrang wi’ ye the day?” she asked kindly.</p>

<p>“Ye&mdash;ye jist mak’ me miserable,” he blurted
out, and hung his head.</p>

<p>“Me!” she said innocently. “I’m sure I never
meant to dae that. I’m a hard nut, I suppose; but
no’ jist as hard as I seem. Onything I can dae to
mak’ ye happy again?”</p>

<p>The door opened, the bell banged, and a man
came in and bought a weekly paper.</p>

<p>“Weel?” said Christina when they were alone.</p>

<p>“Let me walk hame wi’ ye the nicht,” said
Macgregor, who ought to have felt grateful to the
chance customer whose brief stay had permitted
him to get his wits and words together.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Christina.</p>

<p>“I’ll wait for ye as long as ye like.”</p>

<p>Some seconds passed ere Christina spoke. “I’m
not in the habit of being escorted&mdash;&mdash;” she began.</p>

<p>“For ony sake dinna speak like that.”</p>

<p>“I forgot ye wasna a customer. But, seriously,
I dinna think it wud be the thing.”</p>

<p>“What way, Christina?”</p>

<p>“Jist because, an’ for several other reasons
besides. My! it’s gettin’ dark. Time I was
lightin’ up.” She struck a match, applied it to a
long taper, and proceeded to ignite the jets in the
window and above the counter. Then she turned
to him again.</p>

<p>“Mac.”</p>

<p>Something in her voice roused him out of his
despair. “What, Christina?”</p>

<p>“If ye walk hame wi’ me, I’ll expect ye to come
up an’ see ma aunt an’ uncle. Ye see, I made a
sort o’ bargain wi’ them that I wudna ha’e ony
frien’s that they didna ken aboot.”</p>

<p>Macgregor’s expression of happiness gave place
to one of doubt. “Maybe they wudna like me,”
he said.</p>

<p>“Aweel, that’s your risk, of course. But they’ll
no’ bite ye. I leave the shop at eight.” She
glanced at her little silver watch. “Mercy!
It’s time I was puttin’ on the kettle. Miss Tod’ll
be back in a jiffy. Ye best gang, Mac.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be waitin’ for ye at eight,” he said, rising.
“An’ it’s awfu’ guid o’ ye, Christina, though I
wish ye hadna made that <span class="lock">bargain&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Weel, I like to be as honest as I can&mdash;ootside
o’ business. If ye dinna turn up, I’ll forgive ye.
<span class="lock">Noo&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll turn up. It wud tak’ mair nor your
aunt an’ <span class="lock">uncle&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Tits, man!” she cried impatiently, “I’ll be
late wi’ her tea. Adieu for the present.” She
waved her hand and fled to the living-room.</p>

<p>Macgregor went home happy in a subdued
fashion. He found a letter awaiting him. It was
from Grandfather Purdie; it reminded him that his
seventeenth birthday was on the coming Monday,
contained a few kindly words of advice, and
enclosed a postal order for ten shillings. Hitherto
the old man’s gift had been a half-crown, which
had seemed a large sum to the boy. But ten
shillings!&mdash;it would be hard to tell whether Macgregor’s
feeling of manliness or of gratitude was
the greater.</p>

<p>Mrs. Robinson was not a little disturbed when
her son failed to hand over the money to her to
take care of for him, as had been the custom in
the past, and her husband had some difficulty in
persuading her to “let the laddie be in the meantime.”</p>

<p>Macgregor had gone to his room to make the
most elaborate toilet possible.</p>

<p>“You trust him, an’ he’ll trust you,” said John.
“Dinna be aye treatin’ him like a wean.”</p>

<p>“It’s no’ a case o’ no’ trustin’ him,” she returned
a little sharply. “Better treat him like a wean
than let him think he’s a man afore his time.”</p>

<p>“It’s no’ his money in the bank that tells what
a chap’s made o’, Lizzie. Let us wait an’ see what
he does wi’ it. Mind ye, it’s his to dae what he
likes wi’. Wait, till the morn, an’ then I’ll back ye
up in gettin’ him to put a guid part o’ it, onyway,

necessary. If he doesna want to put it in the bank,
he’ll dae it to please us. I’ll guarantee that,
wife.”</p>

<p>“If I had your heart an’ you had ma heid,” she
said with a faint smile, “I daresay we wud baith
be near perfec’, John. Aweel, I’m no’ gaun to
bother the laddie noo. But”&mdash;seriously&mdash;“he’s
been oot an awfu’ lot at nicht the last week or twa.”</p>

<p>“Courtin’,” said John, laughing.</p>

<p>“Havers!” she retorted. “He’s no’ the sort.”</p>

<p>“Neither was I,” said John, “an’ look at me
noo!”</p>

<p>And there they let the subject drop.</p>

<p class="center">&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;</p>

<p>At seven o’clock Macgregor left the house. At
the nearest post-office he had his order converted
into coin. In one of his pockets he placed a couple
of shillings&mdash;for Jeannie and Jimsie. He had no
definite plans regarding the balance, but he hoped
his mother would not ask for it. Somehow its
possession rendered the prospect of his meeting
with the Baldwins a thought less fearsome. He
would tell Christina of his grandfather’s gift, and
later on, perhaps, he would buy&mdash;he knew not
what. All at once he wished he had a <em>great</em> deal
of money&mdash;wished he were clever&mdash;wished he
could talk like Christina, even in the manner he
hated&mdash;wished vague but beautiful things. The
secret aspirations of lad’s love must surely make
the angels smile&mdash;very tenderly.</p>

<p>He reached the trysting place with a quick heart,
a moist brow, and five and twenty minutes to spare.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">CHAPTER TEN</h3>
<hr />
<p class="p2"><span class="sc">From</span> five to seven o’clock on Saturdays M. Tod
and her assistant did a fairly brisk trade in newspapers;
thereafter, as Christina often thought, but
refrained from saying, it was scarcely worth while
keeping the shop open: A stray customer or two
was all that might be expected during the last hour,
and Christina was wont to occupy herself and it by
tidying up for Sunday, while M. Tod from the
sitting-room bleated her conviction, based on
nothing but a fair imagination and a bad memory,
that the Saturday night business was not what it
had been twenty years ago. The old woman
invariably got depressed at the end of the week;
she had come to grudge the girl’s absence even for
a day.</p>

<p>Christina was counting up some unsold
periodicals, chattering cheerfully the while on the
ethics of modern light literature. The door
opened with a suddenness that suggested a pounce,
and a young woman, whom Christina could not
recollect having seen before, started visibly at the
bang of the bell, recovered herself, and closed the
door carefully. It was Christina’s habit to sum
up roughly the more patent characteristics of new
customers almost before they reached the counter.
In the present case her estimate was as follows:
“Handsome for the money; conceited, but not
proud.”</p>

<p>“Good-evening,” she said politely.</p>

<p>“Evenin’,” replied the other, her dark eyes
making a swift survey of the shop. She threw
open her jacket, already unbuttoned, disclosing a
fresh white shirt, a scarlet bow and a silver belt.
Touching the belt, she said: “I think this was got
in your shop.”</p>

<p>Christina bent forward a little way. “Perhaps,”
she said pleasantly. “I couldn’t say for
certain. We’ve sold several of these belts, but of
course we haven’t the monopoly.”</p>

<p>It may have been that the young woman fancied
she was being chaffed. Other customers less unfamiliar
with Christina had fancied the same thing.
At all events her tone sharpened.</p>

<p>“But I happen to ken it was got here.”</p>

<p>“Then it <em>was</em> got here,” said Christina equably.
“Do you wish to buy another the same? I’m
sorry we’re out of them at present, but we could
procure one for you <span class="lock">within&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“No, thanks. An’ I didna buy this one, either.
It was bought by a young gentleman friend of
mines.”</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed!” Christina murmured sympathetically.
Then her eyes narrowed slightly.</p>

<p>“I came to see if you could change it,” the
young woman proceeded. “It’s miles too wide.
Ye can see that for yersel’.”</p>

<p>“They are worn that way at present,” said
Christina, with something of an effort.</p>

<p>“Maybe. But I prefer it tight-fittin’. Of
course I admit I’ve an extra sma’ waist.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;smaller than they are worn at present.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon!”</p>

<p>“Granted,” said Christina absently. She was
trying to think of more than one male customer to
whom she had sold a belt. But there had been
only one.</p>

<p>The dark eyes of the young woman glimmered
with malignant relish.</p>

<p>“As I was sayin’,” she said, “I prefer it tight-fittin’.
I’ve a dance on next week, an’ as it is the
belt is unsuitable, an’ the young man expec’s me to
wear it. Of course I couldna tell him that it
didna fit me. So I thought I would jist ask ye to
change it wi’oot lettin’ on to him.” She gave a
self-conscious giggle.</p>

<p>“I see,” said Christina, dully. “But I’m afraid
there’s only the one size in those belts, and, besides,
we can’t change goods that have been worn for a
month.”</p>

<p>“Oh, so ye mind when ye sold it!” said the
other maliciously. “Ye’ve a fine memory, Miss!
But though I’ve had it for a month&mdash;it was part
o’ his birthday present, ye ken&mdash;I’ve scarcely
worn it&mdash;only once or twice, to please him.”</p>

<p>There was a short silence ere Christina spoke.
“If you are bent on getting the belt made tight-fitting,
a jeweller would do it for you, but it would
cost as much as the belt is worth,” she said coldly.
“It’s a very cheap imitation, you know,” she added,
for the first time in her business career decrying her
own wares.</p>

<p>It was certainly a nasty one, but the young
woman almost succeeded in appearing to ignore it.</p>

<p>“So ye canna change it&mdash;even to please ma
young man?” she said mockingly.</p>

<p>“No,” Christina replied, keeping her face to the
foe, but with difficulty.</p>

<p>Said the foe: “That’s a pity, but I daresay I’ll
get over it.” She moved to the door and opened
it. She smiled, showing her teeth. (Christina
was glad to see they were not quite perfect.) “A
sma’ waist like mines is whiles a misfortune,” she
remarked, with affected self-commiseration.</p>

<p>Christina set her lips, but the retort <em>would</em> come.
“Ay,” she said viciously; “still, I suppose you
couldn’t grow tall any other way.”</p>

<p>But the young woman only laughed&mdash;she could
afford to laugh, having done that which she had
come to do&mdash;and departed to report the result of
her mission to the youth known as Willie Thomson.</p>

<p>“Wha was that, dearie?” M. Tod called from
the living-room.</p>

<p>Christina started from an unlovely reverie.
“Merely a female,” she answered bitterly, and
resumed counting the periodicals in a listless
fashion.</p>

<p>The poison bit deep. The cheek of him to suggest
walking home with <em>her</em> when he was going to
a dance with that tight-laced girl next week! No
doubt he admired her skimpy waist. He was
welcome to it and her&mdash;and her bad teeth. And
yet he had seemed a nice chap. She had liked him
for his shyness, if for nothing else. But the shy
kind were always the worst. He had very likely
been taking advantage of his shyness. Well, she
was glad she had found him out before he could
walk home with her. And possibly because she
was glad, but probably because she was quite young
at heart, tears came to her eyes....</p>

<p>When ten minutes had passed, M. Tod, missing
the cheerful chatter, toddled into the shop.</p>

<p>“What’s wrang, dearie? Preserve us! Ha’e
ye been cryin’?”</p>

<p>“Cryin’!” exclaimed Christina with contempt.
“But I think I’m in for a shockin’ cauld in ma
heid, so ye best keep awa’ frae me in case ye get
the infection. A cauld’s a serious thing at your
time o’ life.” And she got the feebly protesting
old woman back to the fireside, and left her there.</p>

<p class="center">&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;</p>

<p>At eight o’clock Macgregor saw the window
lights go out and the shop lights grow dim. A
minute later he heard an exchange of good-nights
and the closing and bolting of a door. Then
Christina appeared, her head a little higher even
than usual.</p>

<p>He went forward eagerly. He held out his
hand and&mdash;it received his gift of the afternoon
unopened.</p>

<p>“I’ve changed my mind. I’ll bid you good-night&mdash;and
good-bye,” said Christina, and walked
on.</p>

<p>Presently he overtook her.</p>

<p>“Christina, what’s up?”</p>

<p>“Kindly do not address me any more.”</p>

<p>“Any more?&mdash;&mdash;&#8203;Never?&mdash;&mdash;&#8203;What <span class="lock">way?&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>She was gone.</p>

<p>He dashed the little package into the gutter and
strode off in the opposite direction, his face white,
his lip quivering.</p>

<p>If Macgregor seemed in the past to have needed
a thorough rousing, he had it now. For an hour
he tramped the streets, his heart hot within him,
the burden of his thoughts&mdash;“She thinks I’m no’
guid enough.”</p>

<p>And the end of the tramp found him at the door
of the home of Jessie Mary. For a wonder, on a
Saturday night at that hour, she was in. She
opened the door herself.</p>

<p>At the sight of the boy something like fear fell
upon her. For what had he come thus boldly?</p>

<p>He did not keep her in suspense. “Will ye
gang wi’ me to that dance ye was talkin’ aboot?”
he asked abruptly, adding, “I’ve got the money for
the tickets.”</p>

<p>A curse, a blow even, would have surprised her less.</p>

<p>“Will ye gang, Jessie?” he said impatiently.</p>

<p>For the life of her she could not answer at once.</p>

<p>Said he: “If it’s Wullie, ye’re thinkin’ o’, I’ll
square him.”</p>

<p>“Wullie!” she exclaimed, a cruel contempt in
the word.</p>

<p>“Weel, if naebody else is takin’ ye, will ye gang
wi’ me?”</p>

<p>“Dae&mdash;dae ye want me, Macgreegor?”</p>

<p>“I’m askin’ ye.”</p>

<p>She glanced at him furtively, but he was not
looking at her; his hands were in his pockets, his
mouth was shaped to emit a tuneless whistle. She
tried to laugh, but made only a throaty sound.
It seemed as if a stranger stood before her, one of
whom she knew nothing save his name. And yet
she liked that stranger and wanted much to go to
the dance with him.</p>

<p>The whistling ceased.</p>

<p>“Are ye gaun wi’ somebody else?” he demanded,
lifting his face for a moment.</p>

<p>It was not difficult to guess that something acute
had happened to him very recently. Jessie Mary
suddenly experienced a guilty pang. Yet why
Macgregor should have come back to her now was
beyond her comprehension. Yon yellow-haired girl
in the shop could not have told him anything&mdash;that
was certain. And though she had not really
wanted him back, now that he had come she was
fain to hold him once more. Such thoughts made
confusion in her mind, out of which two distinct,
ideas at last emerged: she did not care if she had
hurt the yellow-haired girl; she could not go to the
dance on Macgregor’s money.</p>

<p>So gently, sadly, she told her lie; “Ay, there’s
somebody else, Macgreegor.” Which suggests
that no waist is too small to contain an appreciable
amount of heart and conscience.</p>

<p>A brief pause, and Macgregor said drearily:</p>

<p>“Aweel, it doesna matter.<a name="chg3" id="chg3"></a> I’ll awa’ hame.”
And went languidly down the stairs.</p>

<p>“It doesna matter.” The words haunted
Jessie Mary that night, and it was days before she
got wholly rid of the uncomfortable feeling that
Macgregor had not really wanted her to go to the
dance, and that he had, in fact, been “codding”
her.</p>

<p>Whereas, poor lad, he had only been “codding”
himself, or, at least, trying to do so. By the time
he reached the bottom step he had forgotten Jessie
Mary.</p>

<p class="center">&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;</p>

<p>Once more he tramped the streets.</p>

<p>At home Lizzie was showing her anxiety, and
John was concealing his.</p>

<p>When, at long last, he entered the kitchen, he
did not appear to hear his mother’s “Whaur ha’e
ye been, laddie?” or his father’s “Ye’re late, ma
son.” Their looks of concern at his tired face and
muddy boots passed unobserved.</p>

<p>Having unlaced his boots and rid his feet of
them more quietly than usual, he got up and went
to the table at which his mother was sitting.</p>

<p>He took all the money&mdash;all&mdash;from his pockets
and laid it before her.</p>

<p>“There’s a shillin’ each for Jeannie an’ Jimsie.
I’m no’ needin’ the rest. I’m wearied,” he said,
and went straightway to his own room.</p>

<p>John got up and joined his wife at the table.
“Did I no’ tell ye,” he cried, triumphantly, “that
Macgreegor wud dae the richt thing?”</p>

<p>Lizzie stared at the little heap of silver and
bronze.</p>

<p>“John,” she whispered at last, and there was a
curious distressed note in her voice, “John, d’ye
no’ see?&mdash;he’s gi’ed me ower much!”</p>

<h3 class="h3head">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h3>
<hr />
<p class="p2"><span class="sc">As</span> a rule tonics are bitter, and their effects very
gradual, often so gradual as to be hardly noticeable
until one’s strength is put to some test. While it
would be unfair to deny the existence of “backbone”
in Macgregor, it is but just to grant that the
“backbone” required stiffening. And it is no
discredit to Macgregor that the tincture of Christina’s
hardier spirit which, along with her (to him)
abundant sweetness, he had been absorbing during
these past weeks, was the very tonic he needed,
the tonic without which he could not have acted as
he did on the Monday night following his dismissal.</p>

<p>Of this action one may say, at first thought, that
it was simply the outcome of an outraged pride.
Yet Macgregor’s pride was at best a drowsy thing
until a girl stabbed it. It forced him to Jessie
Mary’s door, but there failed him. Throughout
the miserable Sunday it lay inert, with only an
occasional spasm. And though he went with it to
the encounter on Monday, he carried it as a
burden. His real supporters were Love and
Determination, and the latter was a new comrade,
welcome, but not altogether of his own inspiring.</p>

<p class="center">&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;</p>

<p>He did not go to the shop, for he had neither
money nor the petty courage necessary to ask it of
his parents. On the pavement, a little way from
the door, he waited in a slow drizzle of rain. He
had no doubts as to what he was going to do and
say. The idea had been with him all day, from
early in the morning, and it <em>had</em> to be carried out.
Perhaps his nerves were a little too steady to be
described as normal.</p>

<p>When eight o’clock struck on a neighbouring
tower, he did not start or stir. But across the
street, peering round the edge of a close-mouth,
another boy jerked his head at the sound. Willie
Thomson was exceedingly curious to know whether
Saturday night had seen the end of the matter.</p>

<p>Christina, for no reason that she could have
given, was late in leaving the shop; it was twenty
minutes past the hour when she appeared.</p>

<p>She approached quickly, but he was ready for her.</p>

<p>“No!” she exclaimed at the sight of him.</p>

<p>He stepped right in front of her. She was compelled
to halt, and she had nothing to say.</p>

<p>He faced her fairly, and said&mdash;neither hotly
nor coldly, but with a slight throb in his voice:</p>

<p>“I’ll be guid enough yet.” With a little nod as
if to emphasise his words, and without taking his
eyes from her face, he stood aside and let her go.</p>

<p>Erect, he followed her with his eyes until the
darkness and traffic of the pavement hid her.
Then he seemed to relax, his shoulders drooped
slightly, and with eyes grown wistful he moved
slowly down the street towards home. Arrived
there he shut himself up with an old school
dictionary.</p>

<p>Dull work, but a beginning....</p>

<p>“Guid enough yet.” Christina had not gone far
when through all her resentment the full meaning
of the words forced itself upon her. “Oh,” she
told herself crossly, “I never meant him to take
it that way.” A little later she told herself the
same thing, but merely impatiently. And still
later, lying in the dark, she repeated it with a sob.</p>

<p>As for the watcher, Willie Thomson, he set out
without undue haste to inform Jessie Mary that
once more Macgregor had been left standing alone
on the pavement. Somehow Willie was not particularly
pleased with himself this evening. Ere
his lagging feet had borne him half way to the
appointed place he was feeling sorry for Macgregor.
All at once he decided to spy no more.
It would be rather awkward just at present to
intimate such a decision to Jessie Mary, but he
could “cod” her, he thought, without much difficulty,
by inventing reports in the future. Cheered
by his virtuous resolutions, he quickened his pace.</p>

<p>Jessie Mary received him in the close leading to
her abode. She was in an extraordinarily bad
temper, and cut short his report almost at the outset
by demanding to know when he intended
repaying the shilling he had borrowed a fortnight
previously.</p>

<p>“Next week,” mumbled Willie, with that sad
lack of originality exhibited by nearly all harassed
borrowers.</p>

<p>Whereupon Jessie Mary, who was almost a head
the taller, seized him by one ear and soundly cuffed
the other until with a yelp he broke loose and fled
into the night, never to know that he had been
punished for that unfortunate remark of Macgregor’s&mdash;“it
doesna matter.” Yet let us not
scoff at Jessie Mary’s sense of justice. The possessors
of greater minds than hers, having stumbled
against a chair, have risen in their wrath and kicked
the sofa&mdash;which is not at all to say that the sofa’s
past has been more blameless than the chair’s.
Life has a way of settling our accounts without
much respect for our book-keeping.</p>

<p>Jessie Mary felt none the better of her outbreak.
She went to bed wishing angrily that she had taken
Macgregor at his word. The prospects of obtaining
an escort to the dance were now exceedingly
remote, for only that afternoon she had learned
that the bandy-legged young man in the warehouse
whom she had deemed “safe at a pinch,” and who
was the owner of a dress suit with a white vest,
had invited another girl and was actually going to
give her flowers to wear.</p>

<p>Willie went to bed, too, earlier than usual, and
lay awake wondering, among other things, whether
his aching ear entitled him to a little further credit
in the matter of his debt to Jessie Mary&mdash;not that
any length of credit would have made payment
seem possible. For Willie was up to the neck in
debt, owing the appalling sum of five shillings and
ninepence to an old woman who sold newspapers,
paraffin oil and cheap cigarettes, and who was
already threatening to go to his aunt for her money&mdash;a
proceeding which would certainly result in
much misery for Willie. He was “out of a job”
again; but it isn’t easy to get work, more especially
when one prefers to do nothing. To some extent
Macgregor was to blame for his having got into
debt with the tobacconist, for if Macgregor had not
stopped smoking, Willie would not have needed to
buy nearly so many cigarettes. Nevertheless,
Willie’s thoughts did not dwell long or bitterly on
that point. Rather did they dwell on Macgregor
himself. And after a while Willie drew up his legs
and pulled the insufficient bedclothes over his head
and lay very still. This he had done since he was
a small boy, when lonesomeness got the better of
him, when he wished he had a father and mother
like Macgregor’s.</p>

<p>And, as has been hinted, neither was Christina at
ease that night.</p>

<p>Indeed, it were almost safe to say that of the
four young people involved in this little tragicomedy,
Macgregor, yawning over his old school
dictionary, was the least unhappy.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<hr class="linebox" />
<h3 class="h3head">CHAPTER TWELVE</h3>
<hr />
<p class="p2"><span class="sc">On</span> the fifth night, at the seventh page of words
beginning with a “D,” Macgregor closed the dictionary
and asked himself what was the good of it
all. His face was hot, his whole being restless.
He looked at his watch&mdash;a quarter to eight. He
got up and carefully placed the dictionary under a
copy of “Ivanhoe” on the chest of drawers. He
would go for a walk.</p>

<p>He left the house quietly.</p>

<p>In the kitchen Lizzie, pausing in her knitting,
said to John: “That’s Macgreegor awa’ oot.”</p>

<p>“It’ll dae him nae harm,” said John. “He’s
becomin’ a great reader, Lizzie.”</p>

<p>“I dinna see why he canna read ben here. It’s
cauld in his room. What’s he readin’?”</p>

<p>“The book he got frae his Uncle Purdie three
year back.”</p>

<p>“Weel, I’m sure I’m gled if he’s takin’ an
interest in it at last.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ‘Ivanhoe’ ’s no’ a bad story,” remarked
John. “Whiles it’s fair excitin’.”</p>

<p>Said Jimsie from the hearthrug: “He doesna
seem to enjoy it much, Paw.”</p>

<p>“Weel, it’s no’ a funny book.”</p>

<p>“It’s time ye was in yer bed, Jimsie,” said Mrs.
Robinson. “It’s ower late for ye.”</p>

<p>“Aw, the wean’s fine,” said John.</p>

<p>Jeannie laid down her sewing. “Come on,
Jimsie, an’ I’ll tell ye a wee story afore ye gang to
sleep.”</p>

<p>“Chaps ye!” Jimsie replied, getting up.</p>

<p>When the two had gone, Lizzie observed
casually: “It’s the first nicht Macgreegor’s been
oot this week.”</p>

<p>“Weel, ye should be pleased, wumman.” John
smiled.</p>

<p>A pause.</p>

<p>“I wonder what made him gi’e up a’ his siller on
Seturday nicht.”</p>

<p>“Same here. But I wudna ask him,” said John,
becoming grave. “Wud you?”</p>

<p>She shook her head, “I tried to, on Sunday,
but some way I coudna. He’s changin’.”</p>

<p>“He’s growin’ up, Lizzie.”<a name="chg2" id="chg2"></a></p>

<p>“I suppose ye’re richt,” she said reluctantly, and
resumed her knitting.</p>

<p class="center">&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;</p>

<p>From the darkest spot he could find on the opposite
pavement Macgregor saw Christina come out
of the shop, pass under a lamp, and disappear. He
felt sorely depressed during the return journey.
The dictionary had failed to increase either his
knowledge or his self-esteem. He wondered
whether History or Geography would do any good;
there were books on these subjects in the house.
He realised that he knew nothing about anything
except his trade, and even there he had to admit
that he had learned less than he might have done.
And yet he had always wanted to be a painter.</p>

<p>The same night he started reading the History
of England, and found it a considerable improvement
on the Dictionary. He managed to keep
awake until the arrival of Julius Cæsar. Unfortunately
he had taken the book to bed, and his
mother on discovering it in the morning indiscreetly
asked him what he had been doing with it.
“Naething special,” was his reply, indistinctly
uttered, and here ended his historical studies,
though for days after Lizzie left the book
prominent on the chest of drawers.</p>

<p class="center">&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;</p>

<p>The day being Saturday, the afternoon was his
own. Through the rain he made his way furtively
to a free library, but became too self-conscious at
the door, and fled. For the sum of threepence a
picture house gave him harbourage, and save when
the scenes were very exciting he spent the time in
trying not to wonder what Christina would think
of him, if she thought at all. He came forth
ashamed and in nowise cheered by the entertainment.</p>

<p>In the evening he went once more to watch her
leave the shop. M. Tod came to the door with
her, and they stood talking for a couple of minutes,
so that he had more than a glimpse of her. And a
spirit arose in him demanding that he should
attempt something to prove himself, were it only
with his hands. It was not learning, but earning,
that would make him “guid enough yet”; not what
he could say, but what he could do. There would
be time enough for speaking “genteel English” and
so on after&mdash;well, after he had got up in the world.</p>

<p>For a moment he felt like running after Christina
and making her hearken to his new hope, but
self-consciousness prevailed and sent him homewards.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” From a close came a husky voice,
apologetic, appealing.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Wullie!” Macgregor stopped. He
was not sorry to meet Willie; he craved companionship
just then, though he had no confidence to give.</p>

<p>“Are ye for hame?”</p>

<p>“Ay.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I’ll come wi’ ye, if ye like, Macgreegor?”</p>

<p>“Come on then.”</p>

<p>Willie came out, and they proceeded along
the street without remark until Macgregor <span class="lock">enquired&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Where are ye workin’ the noo, Wullie?”</p>

<p>“I’m no’ workin’. Canna get a job. Dae ye
ken o’ onything?”</p>

<p>“Na. What kin’ o’ job dae ye want?”</p>

<p>“Onything,” said Willie, and added quickly,
“An’ I’ll stick to it this time, if I get the chance.”</p>

<p>After a short pause&mdash;&mdash;“My fayther got ye a
job before,” said Macgregor.</p>

<p>“I ken. But I wud <span class="lock">stick&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Honest?”</p>

<p>Willie drew his hand across his throat.</p>

<p>“Weel,” said Macgregor, “I’ll tell ma fayther,
an’ ye can gang an’ see him at the works on
Monday.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be there. Ye’re a dacent chap, Macgreegor.”</p>

<p>Neither seemed to have anything more to say to
the other, but their parting was cordial enough.</p>

<p>Next day, Sunday, was wet and stormy, and
there was no afternoon stroll of father and son to
the docks. John was flattered by Macgregor’s ill-concealed
disappointment&mdash;it was like old times.
Perhaps he would not have been less flattered had
he known his boy’s desire to tell him out of doors
a thing that somehow could not be uttered in the
house. Macgregor spent the afternoon in studying
secretly an old price-list of Purdie’s Stores.</p>

<p>The following night, while returning from the
errand of previous nights, he again encountered
Willie.</p>

<p>“So may fayther’s gaun to gi’e ye a job. He
tell’t me it was fixed.”</p>

<p>“Ay,” said Willie, “but he canna tak’ me on for
a fortnicht.”</p>

<p>“Weel, that’s no lang to wait.”</p>

<p>For a few seconds Willie was mute; then he
blurted out&mdash;“I’m done for!”</p>

<p>“Done for!” exclaimed Macgregor, startled by
the despair in the other’s voice. “What’s wrang,
Wullie?”</p>

<p>“I’m in a mess. But it’s nae use tellin’ ye. Ye
canna dae onything.”</p>

<p>“Is’t horses?” Macgregor asked presently.</p>

<p>“Naw, it’s no’ horses!” Willie indignantly
replied.</p>

<p>How virtuous we feel when accused of the one
sin we have not committed!</p>

<p>The next moment he clutched Macgregor’s arm.
“Come in here, an’ I’ll tell ye.” He drew his companion
into a close. “I&mdash;I couldna tell onybody
else.”</p>

<p>From the somewhat incoherent recital which
followed Macgregor finally gathered that the old
woman to whom Willie owed money had presented
her ultimatum. If Willie failed to pay up that
night she would assuredly not fail to apply to his
aunt first thing in the morning.</p>

<p>“Never heed, Wullie,” said Macgregor, taking
his friend’s arm, and leading him homewards.
“Yer aunt’ll no’ kill ye.”</p>

<p>“I wish to&mdash;&mdash;&#8203;she wud!” muttered Willie with
a vehemence that shocked his friend. “She’s aye
been ill to live wi’, but it’ll be a sight harder noo.”</p>

<p>“Wud the auld wife no’ believe ye aboot gettin’
a job in a fortnicht? She wudna? Aweell, she’ll
believe me. Come on, an’ I’ll speak to her for ye.”</p>

<p>But the “auld wife” was adamant. She had
been deceived with too many promises ere now.
At last Macgregor, feeling himself beaten, disconsolately
joined Willie and set out for home.
Neither spoke until Macgregor’s abode was reached.
Then Macgregor said:</p>

<p>“Bide here till I come back,” and ran up the
stair. He knew his father was out, having gone
back to the works to experiment with some new
machinery. He found his mother alone in the
kitchen.</p>

<p>“Mither,” he said with difficulty, “I wish ye
wud gi’e me five shillin’s o’ ma money.”</p>

<p>He could not have startled her more thoroughly.</p>

<p>“Five shillin’s, laddie! What for?”</p>

<p>“I canna tell ye the noo.”</p>

<p>“<span class="lock">But&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“It’s no’ for&mdash;for fun. If ye ask me, I’ll tell
ye in a secret this day fortnicht. Please, mither.”</p>

<p>She got up and laid her hands on his shoulder
and turned him to the full light of the gas. He
looked at her shyly, yet without flinching. And
abruptly she kissed him, and as abruptly passed to
the dresser drawer where she kept her purse.</p>

<p>Without a word she put the money in his hand.
Without a word he took it, nodded gravely, and
went out. In one way Lizzie had done more for
her boy in these three minutes than she had done
in the last three years.</p>

<p>Macgregor had a sixpence in his pocket, and he
added it to the larger coins.</p>

<p>“She can wait for her thruppence,” he said,
giving the money to the astounded Willie. “Awa’
an’ pay her. I’ll maybe see ye the morn’s nicht.
So long!” He walked off in the direction opposite
to that which Willie ought to take.</p>

<p>But Willie ran after him; he was pretty nearly
crying. “Macgreegor,” he stammered, “I’ll pay
ye back when I get ma first wages. An’ I’ll no’
forget&mdash;oh, I’ll never forget. An’ I’ll dae ye a
guid turn yet!”</p>

<p>“Ye best hurry in case she shuts her shop,”
said Macgregor, and so got rid of him.</p>

<p>While it is disappointing to record that Willie
has thus far never managed to repay Macgregor
in hard cash, though he has somehow succeeded in
retaining the employment found for him by John,
it is comforting to know that his promise to do
Macgregor a good turn was more than just an
emotional utterance. When, on the following
Wednesday and Friday nights, he stealthily tracked
Macgregor to the now familiar watching place, his
motives were no longer curious or selfish, but
benevolent in the extreme. Not that he could
bring himself to sympathise with Macgregor in the
latter’s devotion to a mere girl, for, as a matter of
fact, he regarded his friend’s behaviour as “awfu’
stupid”; but if Macgregor was really “saft” on
the girl, it behoved him, Willie, to do what he
could to put an end to the existing misunderstanding.</p>

<p>On the Friday night he came regretfully to the
conclusion that the “saftness” was incurable, and
he accordingly determined to act on the following
afternoon. By this time his knowledge of the
movements of M. Tod and her assistant was practically
as complete as Macgregor’s, so that he had
no hesitation in choosing the hour for action. He
had little fear of Macgregor’s coming near the
shop in daylight.</p>

<p>So, having witnessed the exit of M. Tod, he
crossed the street, and examined the contents of
the window, as he had seen Macgregor do so
often. He was not in the least nervous. The fact
that he was without money did not perturb him:
it would be the simplest thing in the world to introduce
himself and his business by asking for an
article which stationers’ shops did not supply. A
glance at a druggist’s window had given him the
necessary suggestion.</p>

<p>On entering he was seized with a most distressing
cough, which racked him while he closed
the door and until he reached the counter.</p>

<p>“A cold afternoon,” Christina remarked in a
sympathetic tone.</p>

<p>“Ay. Ha’e ye ony chest protectors?” he
hoarsely enquired.</p>

<p>For the fraction of a second only she hesitated.
“Not exactly,” she replied. “But I can recommend
this.” From under the counter she brought
a quire of brown paper. “It’s cheaper than flannel
and much more sanitary,” she went on. “There’s
nothing like it for keeping out the cold. You’ve
only got to cut out the shape that suits you.”
She separated a sheet from the quire and spread
it on the counter. “Enough there for a dozen
protectors. Price one penny. I’ll cut them out
for you, if you like.”</p>

<p>“The doctor said I was to get a flannel yin,”
said Willie, forgetting his hoarseness. “Ha’e ye
ony nice ceegarettes the day, miss?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Will ye ha’e ony on Monday?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“When d’ye think ye’ll ha’e some nice ceegarettes?”</p>

<p>Christina’s eyes smiled. “Perhaps,” she said
solemnly, “by the time you’re big enough to
smoke them. Anything else to-day?”</p>

<p>“Ye’re no’ sae green,” he said, with grudging
admiration.</p>

<p>“No,” said she; “it’s only the reflection.” She
opened the glass case and took out an infant’s
rattle. “Threepence!”</p>

<p>Willie laughed. “My! ye’re a comic!” he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Children are easily amused.”</p>

<p>There was a short pause. Then Willie, leaning
his arms on the edge of the counter, looked up in
her face and said:</p>

<p>“So you’re the girl that’s mashed on Macgreegor
Robi’son.” He grinned.</p>

<p>A breath of silence&mdash;a sounding smack.</p>

<p>Willie sprang back, his hand to his cheek.
Christina, cheeks flaming, eyes glistening, teeth
gleaming, hands clenched, drew herself up and faced
him.</p>

<p>“Get oot o’ this!” she cried. “D’ye hear me!
Get <span class="lock">oot&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Ay, I hear ye,” said Willie resentfully, rubbing
his cheek. “Ye’re ower smart wi’ yer han’s.
I meant for to <span class="lock">say&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Be quiet!”</p>

<p>“&mdash;you’re the girl Macgreegor’s mashed on&mdash;an’
<span class="lock">I&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>Christina stamped her foot. “Clear oot, I tell
ye!”</p>

<p>“&mdash;I wudna be Macgreegor for a thoosan’
pounds! Keep yer hair on, miss. I’ll gang when
it suits me. Ye’ve got to <span class="lock">hear&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“I’ll no’ listen.” She put her hands to her ears.</p>

<p>“Thon girl, Jessie Mary, took a rise oot o’ ye
last week, an’ it was me that put her up to it.
Macgreegor gi’ed her the belt, richt enough, but
that was afore he got saft on <span class="lock">you&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Silence! I cannot hear a word you say,”
declared Christina, recovering herself and her
more formal speech, though her colour, which had
faded, now bloomed again.</p>

<p>“I’ll cry it loud, if ye like, so as the folk in the
street can hear. But ye can pretend ye dinna
hear,” he said ironically. “I’m no’ heedin’
whether ye hear or no’.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would go away, you impertinent
thing!”</p>

<p>“Macgreegor&mdash;&mdash;” he began.</p>

<p>Once more she covered her ears.</p>

<p>“Macgreegor,” proceeded Willie, with a rude
wink, “never had ony notion o’ takin’ Jessie Mary
to the dance. She was jist coddin’ ye, though I
daursay she was kin’ o’ jealous because ye had cut
her oot. So I think ye should mak’ it up wi’ Macgreegor
when ye get the chance. He’s awfu’ saft
on ye. I wudna be him for <span class="lock">a&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Go away!” said Christina. “You’re simply
wasting your breath.”</p>

<p>“Dinna let on to Macgreegor that I tell’t ye,”
he continued, unmoved, “an’,<a name="chg1" id="chg1"></a> if Jessie Mary tries it
on again, jist you put yer finger to yer nose at her.”</p>

<p>“If you don’t go at once, I’<span class="lock">ll&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Oh, ye canna dae onything, miss. I’ll forgi’e
ye for that scud ye gi’ed me, but I wud advise ye
no’ to be so quick wi’ yer han’s in future, or ye’ll
maybe get into trouble.” He turned towards the
door. “I daursay ye ken fine that Macgreegor
watches ye leavin’ the shop every <span class="lock">nicht&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“What <em>are</em> you talking about?”</p>

<p>“Gi’e him a whistle or a wave the next time.
There’s nae use in bein’ huffy.”</p>

<p>“That’s enough!”</p>

<p>Willie opened the door. “An’ ye best hurry up,
or ye’ll maybe loss him. So long. I’ll no’ tell
him I seen ye blushin’.”</p>

<p>Christina opened her mouth, but ere she could
speak, with a grin and a wink he was gone. She
collapsed upon the stool. She had never been so
angry in her life&mdash;at least, so she told herself.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h3>
<hr />
<p class="p2"><span class="sc">John Robinson</span> and his son sat on a pile of timber
at the docks. Dusk was falling, and the air
that had been mild for the season was growing chill.</p>

<p>John replaced his watch in his pocket. “It’s
comin’ on for tea-time. Are ye ready for the
road, Macgreegor?”</p>

<p>“Ay,” said the boy, without stirring.</p>

<p>For two hours he had been struggling to utter the
words on which he believed his future depended.</p>

<p>“Weel,” said John, getting out his pipe preparatory
to lighting it on passing the gate, “we best be
movin’.”</p>

<p>It was now or never. Macgregor cleared his
throat.</p>

<p>“The pentin’ trade’s rotten,” he said in a voice
not his own.</p>

<p>“Eh?” said John, rather staggered by the
statement which was without relevance to any of
the preceding conversation. “What’s rotten aboot
it?”</p>

<p>“Everything.”</p>

<p>“That’s the first I’ve heard o’ ’t. In fac’, I’m
tell’t the pentin’ trade is extra brisk the noo.”</p>

<p>“That’s no’ what I meant,” Macgregor forced
himself to say. “I meant it was a rotten trade to
be in.”</p>

<p>John gave a good-humoured laugh. “Oh, I
see! Ye dinna like the overtime! Aweel, that’s
nateral at your age, Macgreegor”&mdash;he patted his
son’s shoulder&mdash;“but when ye’re aulder, wi’ a
wife an’ weans, maybe, ye’ll be gled o’ overtime
whiles, I’m thinkin’.”</p>

<p>“It’s no the overtime,” said Macgregor.</p>

<p>“What is’t, then? What’s wrang wi’ the
trade?” The question was lightly put.</p>

<p>“There’s&mdash;there’s nae prospec’s in it for a
man.”</p>

<p>“Nae prospec’s! Hoots, Macgreegor! there’s
as guid prospec’s in the pentin’ as in ony ither
trade. Dinna fash yer heid aboot that&mdash;no’ but
what I’m pleased to ken ye’re thinkin’ aboot yer
prospec’s, ma son. But we’ll speak aboot it on the
road hame.”</p>

<p>“I wish,” said Macgregor, with the greatest
effort of all, “I wish I had never gaed into it. I
wish I had gaed into Uncle Purdie’s business.”</p>

<p>John sat down again. At last he said: “D’ye
mean that, Macgreegor?”</p>

<p>“Ay, I mean it.”</p>

<p>For the first time within his memory John Robinson
felt disappointed&mdash;in a vague fashion, it is
true, yet none the less unpleasantly disappointed&mdash;in
his son.</p>

<p>“But ye’ve been at the pentin’ for three year,”
he said a little impatiently.</p>

<p>“I ken that, fayther.”</p>

<p>“An’ ye mind ye had the chance o’ gaun into yer
uncle’s business when ye left the schule?”</p>

<p>“Ay.”</p>

<p>“But ye wud ha’e naething but the pentin’.”</p>

<p>Macgregor nodded.</p>

<p>“Maybe ye mind that yer Aunt Purdie was unco
offended, for it was her notion&mdash;at least, it was
her that spoke aboot it&mdash;an’ she declared ye wud
never get a second chance. D’ye no’ mind, Macgreegor?”</p>

<p>“I mind aboot her bein’ offended, but I dinna
mind aboot&mdash;the ither thing,” Macgregor answered
dully.</p>

<p>“But <em>I</em> mind it, for she was rale nesty to yer
mither at the time. In fac’, I dinna ken hoo yer
mither stood her impiddence. An’, in a way, it
was a’ ma fau’t, for it was me that said ye was to
choose the trade that ye liked best&mdash;an’ I thocht
I was daein’ the richt thing, because I had seen
lads spiled wi’ bein’ forced into trades they didna
fancy. Ay, I thocht I was daein’ the richt thing&mdash;&mdash;&#8203;An’
noo ye’re tellin’ me I did the wrang
thing.”</p>

<p>“Fayther, it’s me that’s to blame. I&mdash;I didna
mean to vex ye.”</p>

<p>“Aweel, I dinna suppose ye did,” said John
sadly. “But for the life o’ me I canna see hoo ye
can hope to get into yer uncle’s business at this time
o’ day.... But we’ll be keepin’ yer mither
waitin’.”</p>

<p>He rose slowly and Macgregor joined him. At
the gate John apparently forgot to light his pipe.
They were half way home ere he spoke.</p>

<p>He put his hand round his son’s arm. “Ye’re
no’ to think, Macgreegor, that I wud stan’ in yer
road when ye want to better yersel’. No’ likely!
I never was set on bein’ a wealthy man masel’, but
naethin’ wud mak’ me prooder nor to see you gang
up in the world; an’ I can say the same for yer
mither. An’ I can see that ye micht gang far in
yer uncle’s business, for yer uncle was aye fond o’
ye, an’ I think ye could manage to please him at yer
work, if ye was tryin’. <em>But</em>&mdash;ye wud need yer
aunt’s favour to begin wi’, an’ that’s the bitter
truth, an’ she’s no’ the sort o’ body that forgets
what she conseeders an affront. Weel, it’ll need
some thinkin’ ower. I’ll ha’e to see what yer
mither says. An’ ye best no’ expec’ onything.
Stick to the pentin’ in the meantime, an’ be vera
certain afore ye quit the trade ye’re in. That’s a’
I can say, ma son.”</p>

<p>Macgregor had no words then. Never before
had his father seriously spoken at such length to
him. His heart was heavy, troubled about many
things.</p>

<p class="center">&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;</p>

<p>Eight o’clock on Monday night saw him at the
accustomed spot; on Wednesday night also he was
there. If only Christina had been friends with
him he would have asked her what he ought to do.
Yet the mere glimpse of her confirmed him in his
desire to change his trade. On the Wednesday
night it seemed to him that she walked away from
the shop much more slowly than usual, and the
horrid thought that she might be giving some other
“man” a chance to overtake her assailed him.
But at last she was gone without that happening.</p>

<p>On the way home he encountered Jessie Mary.
She greeted him affably, and he could not but stop.</p>

<p>“Lovely dance on Friday. Ye should ha’e been
there. Ma belt was greatly admired,” she remarked.</p>

<p>“Was it?”</p>

<p>“I think I’ve seen the shop where ye bought it,”
she said, watching his face covertly.</p>

<p>It’s likely,” he replied, without emotion.</p>

<p>Jessie Mary was relieved; evidently he was without
knowledge of her visit to the shop. Now that
the world was going well with her again she bore
no ill-will, and was fain to avoid any. For at the
eleventh hour&mdash;or, to be precise, the night before
the dance&mdash;she had miraculously won back the
allegiance of the young man with the exquisite
moustache, who served in the provision shop, and
for the present she was more than satisfied with
herself.</p>

<p>So she bade Macgregor good-night, a little
patronisingly perhaps, and hurried off to reward
her recovered swain with the pleasant sight of
herself and an order for a finnan haddie.</p>

<p>Macgregor was still in the dark as to whether his
father had mentioned to his mother the subject of
that conversation at the docks. John had not
referred to it again, and the boy was beginning to
wonder if his case was hopeless.</p>

<p>On the Friday night, however, just when he was
about to slip from the house, his mother followed
him to the door. Very quietly she said:</p>

<p>“When ye come in, Macgreegor, I want ye to
tell me if ye’re still set on leavin’ the pentin’.
Dinna tell me noo. Tak’ yer walk, an’ think it
ower, seriouslike. But dinna be late, laddie.”</p>

<p>She went back to the kitchen, leaving him to shut
the door.</p>

<p>It was not much after seven o’clock, but he went
straightway in the direction of M. Tod’s shop.
For the first time in what seemed an age, he found
himself at the familiar, glittering window. And
lo! the glazed panel at the back was open a few
inches. Quickly he retreated to the edge of the
pavement, and stood there altogether undecided.
But desire drew him, and gradually he approached
the window again.</p>

<p>Christina was sitting under the lamp, at the desk,
her pretty profile bent over her writing, her fair
plait falling over the shoulder of her scarlet shirt.
She was engaged in pencilling queer little marks on
paper, and doing so very rapidly. Macgregor
understood that she was practising shorthand. No
doubt she would be his uncle’s private secretary
some day, while <span class="lock">he&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>All at once it came to him that no one in the
world could answer the great question but Christina.
If the thing didn’t matter to Christina, it
didn’t matter to him; it was for her sake that he
would strive to be “guid enough yet,” not for the
sake of being “guid enough” in itself. Besides,
she had put the idea into his head. Surely she
would not refuse to speak to him on that one
subject.</p>

<p>Now all this was hardly in accordance with the
brave and independent plan which Macgregor had
set out to follow&mdash;to wit, that he would not
attempt to speak to Christina until he could announce
that he was a member of his uncle’s staff.
Yes, love is the great maker of plans&mdash;also, the
great breaker.</p>

<p>Coward or not, it took courage to enter the shop.</p>

<p>Christina looked up, her colour deepening
slightly.</p>

<p>“Hullo,” she said coolly, though not coldly.</p>

<p>It was not a snub anyway, and Macgregor
walked up to the counter. He came to the point
at once.</p>

<p>“Wud ye advise me to try an’ get a job frae ma
uncle?” he said, distinctly enough.</p>

<p>“Me?” The syllable was fraught with intense
astonishment.</p>

<p>“Ye advised me afore to try it,” he said, fairly
steadily.</p>

<p>“Did I?”&mdash;carelessly.</p>

<p>It was too much for him. “Oh, Christina!” he
whispered reproachfully.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sure it’s none of my business. I
thought you preferred being a painter.”</p>

<p>The pity was that Christina should have just then
remembered the existence of such a person as
Jessie Mary, also the fact of her own slow walk
from the shop the previous night. Yet she had
forgotten both when she opened the panel at the
back of the window a few inches. And perhaps
she was annoyed with herself, knowing that she
was not behaving quite fairly.</p>

<p>He let her remark concerning his preference for
the painting pass, and put a very direct question.</p>

<p>“What made ye change yer mind aboot me that
night?”</p>

<p>“What night?” she asked flippantly, and told
herself it was the silliest thing she had ever uttered.</p>

<p>She had gone too far&mdash;she saw it in his face.</p>

<p>“I didna think ye was as bad as that,” he said
in a curiously hard voice, and turned from the
counter.</p>

<p>Quick anger&mdash;quick compunction&mdash;quick fear&mdash;and
then:</p>

<p>“Mac!”</p>

<p>He wheeled at the door. She was holding out
her hand. Her smile was frail.</p>

<p>“Are ye in earnest?” he said in a low voice,
but he did not wait for her answer.</p>

<p>She drew away her hand, gently. “Dinna ask
me ony questions,” she pleaded. “I&mdash;I didna
really mean what I said that night, or this night
either. I think I was off my onion”&mdash;a faint
laugh&mdash;“but I’m sorry I behaved the way I did.
Is that enough?”</p>

<p>It was more than enough; how much more he
could not say. “I’ve missed ye terrible,” he
murmured.</p>

<p>Christina became her practical self. “So ye’re
for tryin’ yer uncle’s business&mdash;&mdash;” she began.</p>

<p>“If he’ll gi’e me the chance.”</p>

<p>“Weel, I’m sure I wish ye the best o’ luck.”</p>

<p>“Then ye think I ought to try?” This with
great eagerness.</p>

<p>“If ye’ve made up yer mind it’s for the best,”
she answered cautiously.</p>

<p>He had to be satisfied with that. “Will I let ye
ken if it comes off?”</p>

<p>She nodded. Then she glanced at her watch.</p>

<p>“Can&mdash;can I get walkin’ hame wi’ ye, Christina?”
It was out before he knew.</p>

<p>She shook her head. “Uncle said he wud come
for me; he had some business up this way. If ye
wait a minute, ye’ll see him. I’ll introduce ye.
He’ll be interested seein’ ye’re a nephew o’ Mr.
Purdie.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I couldna. I best hook it. But, Christina,
I can come to-morrow, eh?”</p>

<p>She laughed. “I canna prevent ye. But I’ll
no’ be here in the afternoon. Uncle’s takin’ auntie
an’ me to a matinée, an’ I’ll no’ be back much afore
six.”</p>

<p>“Weel, I’ll meet ye at eight an’ walk hame wi’
ye.”</p>

<p>“Will ye?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Christina; say ’ay.’”</p>

<p>“I’ll consider it.”</p>

<p>And he had to be satisfied with that, too, for
at this point the noisy door opened to admit a
tall, clean-shaven, pleasant-featured man of middle-age.</p>

<p>“Hullo, uncle!” cried Christina.</p>

<p>Macgregor fled, but not without gaining a quick
smile that made all the difference in the world to
him.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later he hurried into the home
kitchen.</p>

<p>“Mither, I’ve decided to leave the pentin’.”
The moment he said it his heart misgave him, and
the colour flew to his face. But he need not have
doubted his parents.</p>

<p>“Weel, ma son,” said John soberly, “we’ll dae
the best we can wi’ yer Aunt Purdie.”</p>

<p>“Jist that,” said Lizzie.</p>

<p>And that was all.</p>

<p class="center">&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;</p>

<p>An urgent piece of work had to be done the
following afternoon, and he was later than usual,
for a Saturday, in getting home. He found his
mother preparing to go out, and his father looking
strangely perplexed.</p>

<p>“She’s gaun to see yer Aunt Purdie,” said John
in a whisper.</p>

<p>Macgregor looked from one to the other, hesitated,
and went over to Lizzie. He put his hand
on her arm.</p>

<p>“Mither, ye’re no’ to gang. I&mdash;I’ll gang
masel’.”</p>

<p>Then, indeed, Lizzie Robinson perceived that
her boy was in danger of becoming a man.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h3>
<hr />
<p class="p2"><span class="sc">To</span> press the little black button at the door of
his aunt’s handsome west-end flat was the biggest
thing Macgregor had ever done. As a small boy
he had feared his Aunt Purdie, as a schoolboy he
had hated her, as a youth he had despised her; his
feelings towards her now were not to be described,
but it is certain that they included a well-nigh
overpowering sense of dread; indeed, the faint
thrill of the electric bell sent him back a pace
towards the stair. His state of perspiration gave
place to one of miserable chillness.</p>

<p>A supercilious servant eyed his obviously
“good” clothes and bade him wait. Nevertheless,
a sting was what Macgregor needed just then; it
roused the fighting spirit. When the servant returned,
and in an aloof fashion&mdash;as though, after
all, it was none of her business&mdash;suggested that
he might enter, he was able to follow her across
the hall, with its thick rugs and pleasantly warm
atmosphere, to the drawing-room, without faltering.
Less than might have been expected the
grandeur of his surroundings impressed&mdash;or
depressed&mdash;him, for in the course of his trade he
had grown familiar with the houses of the rich.
But he had enough to face in the picture without
looking at the frame.</p>

<p>Mrs. Purdie was seated at the side of the glowing
hearth, apparently absorbed in the perusal of a
charitable society’s printed list of donations.</p>

<p>“Your nephew, ma’am,” the servant respectfully
announced and retired.</p>

<p>Mrs. Purdie rose in a manner intended to be
languid. Macgregor had not seen the large yet
angular figure for two years. With his hat in his
left hand he went forward holding out his right.
A stiff, brief handshake followed.</p>

<p>“Well, Macgregor, this is quite an unexpected
pleasure,” she said, unsmiling, resuming her seat.
“Take a chair. It is a considerable period since
I observed you last.” Time could not wither the
flowers of language for Mrs. Purdie. “You are
getting quite a big boy. How old are you now?
Are your parents in good health?” She did not
wait for answers to these inquiries. “I am sorry
your uncle is not at home. His commercial pursuits
confine him to his new and commodious
premises even on Saturday afternoons.” (At that
moment Mr. Purdie was smoking a pipe in the
homely parlour of Christina’s uncle, awaiting his
old friend’s return from the theatre.) “His
finance is exceedingly high at present.” With a
faint smack of her lips she paused, and cast an
inquiring glance at her visitor.</p>

<p>Macgregor saw the ice, so to speak, before him.
The time had come. But he did not go tapping
round the edge. Gathering himself together, he
leaped blindly.</p>

<p>In a few ill-chosen words he blurted out his
petition.</p>

<p>Then there fell an awful silence. And then&mdash;he
could hardly believe his own ears!</p>

<p>There are people in the world who seem hopelessly
unloveable until you&mdash;perforce, perhaps&mdash;ask
of them a purely personal favour. There may
even be people who leave the world with their
fountains of goodwill still sealed simply because
no one had the courage or the need to break the
seals for them. Until to-day the so-called favours
of Aunt Purdie had been mere patronage and cash
payments.</p>

<p>Even now she could not help speaking patronisingly
to Macgregor, but through the patronage
struggled a kindliness and sympathy of which her
relations so long used to her purse-pride, her affectations,
her absurdities, could never have imagined
her capable. She made no reference to the past;
she suggested no difficulties for the present; she cast
no doubts upon the future. Her nephew, she declared,
had done wisely in coming to her; she
would see to it that he got his chance. It seemed
to Macgregor that she promised him ten times all
he would have dreamed of asking. Finally she
bade him stay to dinner and see his uncle; then perceiving
his anxiety to get home and possibly, also,
his dread of offending her by expressing it, she
invited him for the following Sunday evening, and
sent him off with a full heart and a light head.</p>

<p class="center">&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;</p>

<p>He burst into the kitchen, bubbling over with
his wonderful news. During its recital John gave
vent to noisy explosions of satisfaction, Jeannie
beamed happily, Jimsie stared at his transformed
big brother, and Lizzie, though listening with all
her ears, began quietly to prepare her son’s tea.</p>

<p>“An’ so she treated ye weel, Macgreegor,” said
John, rubbing his hands, while the speaker paused
for words.</p>

<p>“She did that! An’ I’m to get dooble the
wages I’m gettin’ the noo, an’ I’ve to spend the
half o’ them on night classes, for, ye see, I’m to
learn <em>everything</em> aboot the business, an’ <span class="lock">then&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>Said Lizzie gently: “Wud ye like yer egg biled
or fried, dearie?”</p>

<p class="center">&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;</p>

<p>It was nearly eight o’clock when he reached the
shop, and he decided to wait at a short distance
from the window until Christina came out. He
was not going to risk interruption by the old woman
or a late customer; he would tell his wonderful
tale in the privacy of the busy pavement, under
the secrecy of the noisy street. Yet he was desperately
impatient, and with every minute after the
striking of the hour a fresh doubt assailed him.</p>

<p>At last the lights in the window went out, and
the world grew brighter. Presently he was moving
to meet her, noting dimly that she was wearing
a bigger hat than heretofore.</p>

<p>The affected surprise at the sight of him, but
not at his eagerly whispered announcement:</p>

<p>“I’ve got it!”</p>

<p>“Good for you,” she said kindly, and refrained
from asking him, teasingly, where he thought he
was going. “It was lovely at the theatre,” she
remarked, stepping forward.</p>

<p>“Dae ye no’ want to hear aboot it?” he asked,
disappointed, catching up with her.</p>

<p>“Of course,” she said cheerfully. “Was yer
uncle nice?”</p>

<p>“It was ma aunt,” he explained somewhat reluctantly,
for he feared she might laugh. But she
only nodded understandingly, and, relieved, he
plunged into details.</p>

<p>“Ye’ve done fine,” she said when he had finished&mdash;for
the time being, at anyrate. “I’m afraid
it’ll be you that’ll be wantin’ a private secretary
when I get that length.”</p>

<p>“Dinna laugh at me,” he murmured reproachfully.</p>

<p>“Dinna be ower serious, Mac,” she returned.
“Ye’ll get on a’ the better for bein’ able to tak’ a
joke whiles. I’m as pleased as Punch aboot
it.”</p>

<p>He was more pleased, if possible. “If it hadna
been for you, Christina, I wud never ha’e had the
neck to try it,” he said warmly.</p>

<p>“I believe ye!” she said quaintly.</p>

<p>“But it’s the truth&mdash;an’ I’ll never forget it.”</p>

<p>“A guid memory’s a gran’ thing! An’ when
dae ye start wi’ yer uncle?”</p>

<p>“Monday week.”</p>

<p>“That’s quick work. Ye’ve beat me a’ to
sticks. Dinna get swelled heid!”</p>

<p>“Christina, I wish ye <span class="lock">wudna&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“I canna help it. It’s the theatre, I suppose.
Oh, I near forgot to tell ye, yer uncle was in when
we got hame frae the theatre. I hadna time to
speak to him, for I had to run back to the shop.
Hadna even time to change ma dress. I think yer
uncle whiles gets tired o’ bein’ a rich man an’ livin’
in a swell house. Maybe <em>you’ll</em> feel that way some
day.”</p>

<p>He let her run on, now and then glancing wistfully
at her pretty, animated face. The happiness,
the triumph, he had anticipated were not his. But
all the more they were worth working for.</p>

<p>So they came to the place where she lived.</p>

<p>“Come up,” she said easily; “I tell’t auntie I
wud maybe bring ye up for supper.”</p>

<p>Doubtless it was the shock of gratification as
much as anything that caused him to hang back.
She had actually mentioned him to her aunt!</p>

<p>“Will ma uncle be there?” he stammered at last.</p>

<p>“Na, na. Ye’ll see plenty o’ <em>him</em> later on!”</p>

<p>“Maybe yer aunt winna be <span class="lock">pleased&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Come on, Mac! Ye’re ower shy for this
world!” she laughed encouragingly.</p>

<p>They went up together.</p>

<p>Christina had a latch-key, and on opening the
door, said:</p>

<p>“Oh, they haven’t come home yet. Out for a
walk, I suppose. But they’ll be home in a minute.
Come in. There’s a peg for your hat.”</p>

<p>She led the way into a fire-lit room and turned
up the gas. Macgregor saw a homely, cosy
parlour, something like his grandfather’s at Rothesay,
but brighter generally. A round table was
trimly laid for supper. In the window a small
table supported a typewriter and a pile of printed
and manuscript books, the sight of which gave him
a sort of sinking feeling.</p>

<p>“Sit down,” she said, indicating an easy-chair.
“Auntie and uncle won’t be long.”</p>

<p>He took an ordinary chair, and tried hard to look
at his ease.</p>

<p>As she took off her hat at the mirror over the
mantelpiece she remarked: “You’ll like uncle at
once, and you’ll like auntie before long. She’s still
a wee bit prim.”</p>

<p>He noticed that her speech had changed with
entering the house, but somehow the “genteel
English” did not seem so unnatural now. He
supposed he would have to learn to speak it, too,
presently.</p>

<p>“But she is the best woman in the world,”
Christina continued, patting her hair, “and she’ll
be delighted about you going into your uncle’s business.
I think it was splendid of you managing
your aunt so well.”</p>

<p>Macgregor smiled faintly. “I doobt it was her
that managed me,” he said. “But, Christina, I’ll
no’ let her be sorry&mdash;nor&mdash;nor you either.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m sure you’ll get on quickly,” she said,
gravely, bending to unbutton her long coat.</p>

<p>“I intend to dae that,” he cried, uplifted by her
words. “Gi’e me a year or twa, an’ I’ll show ye!”</p>

<p>She slipped out of the coat, and stood for a
moment, faintly smiling, in her best frock, a simple
thing of pale grey lustre relieved with white, her
best black shoes, her best thread stockings, her
heavy yellow plait over her left shoulder.</p>

<p>The boy caught his breath.</p>

<p>“Just a minute,” she said, and left the room to
put away her coat and hat.</p>

<p>Macgregor half turned in his chair, threw his
arms upon the back and pressed his brow to his
wrist.</p>

<p>So she found him on her return.</p>

<p>“Sore head, Mac?” she asked gently, recovering
from her surprise, and going close to him.</p>

<p>“Let me gang,” he whispered; “I&mdash;I’ll never
be guid enough.”</p>

<p>The slight sound of a key in the outer door
reached the girl’s ears. She gave her eyes an impatient
little rub.</p>

<p>She laid a hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Cheer up!” she said, almost roughly, and
stooping quickly, she touched her lips to his hair,
so lightly, so tenderly, that he was not aware.</p>
